<h2>
CHAPTER I.
</h2>
<p>
<i>Reappearance of an unexpected customer; together with what passed at a
certain interview.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>AY had pretty well broken as Colin trudged back homewards alone. It was
one of those dull, leaden, misty, and chilly mornings, which in a town
newly stirring from sleep seems to put the stamp and seal of melancholy
upon everything external. The buildings at hand looked black,&mdash;those
at a distance fused into mere shadows by the density of the windless
atmosphere,&mdash;while the unextinguished lamps grew red-eyed and dim in
the white light that had risen over them. Early labourers were trudging to
their work; an occasional milkmaid, who looked precisely as though she had
never seen a cow in the whole course of her life, banged her pail-handles,
and whooped at area-gates; while bakers, who had been up nearly all night
manufacturing hot rolls for that interesting portion of the community now
snug in bed, slipped down the shutters of their houses leisurely, and
stared lack-a-daisically upon the portents of the weather.
</p>
<p>
Altogether, it was a description of scenery by no means calculated to
inspire heavy hearts with unusual joy, or to raise the spirits of any one
situated as was poor Colin.
</p>
<p>
Scarcely knowing what else to do, he turned off at the top of Cheapside,
and walked into a well-known coffeehouse in the immediate vicinity of the
Post-office, where he ordered breakfast. Two or three tables occupied the
room, at which a few early risers were sitting quaffing coffee from cups
which, from their size and shape, might readily have been mistaken for so
many half-pint pots of ale. Well-fingered books were scattered about the
place, and monthly magazines of all sorts, fitted into temporary covers,
lay in piles upon the broad chimney-piece. Shortly afterwards the morning
papers were brought in by a lad with a large bundle of them under his arm&mdash;a
circumstance productive of a momentary scramble on the part of those who
were anxious to possess themselves of the earliest intelligence of the
day, before departing to their occupations. Colin's breakfast was
introduced by a little active boy, as brisk as a sand-eel, who waited in
the place; and scarcely had Colin begun stirring the mysterious-looking
fluid before him with an old dingy pewter spoon, bent one way out at the
bottom and the other way at top, by way, perhaps, of producing a
counteracting influence, than he involuntarily started as though he had
received the shock of an overcharged battery. The spoon dropped from his
hand, and his hand dropped upon his coffee-cup, and upset it. He had heard
the voice of Jerry Clink in another part of the room!
</p>
<p>
It appeared to Colin, if not absolutely impossible, at least the height of
improbability, that the veritable Jerry Clink himself could be there in
his own proper person. There, however, he assuredly was; a fact which his
grandson's eyes soon confirmed, when he peeped round a projecting corner
of the room, and beheld the man with whom he had recently had so fierce a
struggle sitting in his wet clothes, and minus his coat, within a very
short distance of him.
</p>
<p>
For reasons sufficiently obvious, and to prevent any farther public
demonstration of Jerry's temper, Colin suffered him to take his meal in
quiet, and afterwards his departure, without making his own presence known
to him. Anxious, however, not wholly to lose sight of him again, as the
liberation of Mr. Woodruff appeared very singularly to depend upon him,
though in a manner yet unaccounted for, Colin quietly followed and dodged
him along the streets, until he observed him enter an old clothes shop in
the Goswell-road, from which, after a convenient lapse of time, he again
emerged with a coat on,&mdash;new to the present possessor, though old in
the opinion of the gentleman whose shoulders it had previously adorned.
</p>
<p>
In this manner he followed unperceived in the old man's wake, but did not
venture to accost him until, after a very considerable walk, he pulled up
for refreshment at a small deserted-looking public house at the rear of
Islington, which appeared to offer the privacy requisite for their second
meeting, and the conversation that might thereon ensue.
</p>
<p>
As Jerry had no particular desire, under present circumstances, to mingle
with all such chance customers as might come in, he avoided the common
drinking-room, and walked into a parlour, the air of which smelt like that
of a well some time since fumigated with tobacco smoke, that required more
than ordinary time finally to make its escape. The floor was spread with
coarse sand, not unlike gravel in a state of childhood; while the window
looked out upon a back-yard nearly as large as an ordinary closet, and in
obscurity very strongly resembling a summer twilight.
</p>
<p>
As the old man seemed inclined to stop a while, a fat untidy girl, with
her hair half out of her cap, and her countenance curiously smeared with
ashes and black-lead, came in to light a fire already &ldquo;built&rdquo; in the
grate.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Glass of ale?&rdquo; demanded the girl, as she blew out her candle, and nipped
the snuff with her fingers.
</p>
<p>
Jerry fixed his eyes upon her with a degree of sternness amounting almost
to ferocity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What master or mistress taught you, young woman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to ask a
gentleman coming into your house to take a glass of ale, before it is
ascertained that he drinks such a thing as malt liquor of any kind? Learn
your business better, miss, and go and bring me some hot water, and half a
quartern of rum in it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Scarcely had the girl departed before Colin entered the room. Jerry looked
at him during a space of some moments, and then turned to the fire, or
rather fire-place, without uttering a word.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is almost more than might have been expected,&rdquo; observed Colin, taking
a chair, and speaking in an assumed tone of careless surprise, &ldquo;that I
should have the good fortune to meet with you so early again this morning.
But I am thankful indeed to find you alive and unharmed, after expecting
nothing less than that you must have met your death in a dozen different
dangers.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i> thankful!&rdquo; exclaimed Jerry. &ldquo;Nay, nay, now!&mdash;What!
hypocritical, like all the rest of the world? You care nothing for me, so
don't pretend it,&mdash;no, nor for your mother either. Though a poor old
man, sir, I am proud to be honest; and from this day forwards shall disown
<i>you</i>, and would, though you were made the greatest man in England.
You are too great a coward, sir.'&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To be induced to lift my hand against the life of a man who has
befriended me, and is my own father, too, most certainly I am,&rdquo; replied
Colin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What&mdash;bribery! bribery?&rdquo; exclaimed Jerry; &ldquo;purchased with fine
clothes, I see! Well, well, you are your father's son, not mine. I say,
you are too much of the worm.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To injure my father, I am.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Or to revenge your mother's wrongs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, sir; I deny it. But I will not do it as you wish.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And any other way it is impossible.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; replied Colin. &ldquo;An injury may be great; but there is such a
thing as restitution. Mr. Lupton is very kind to <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;To you? But what is that to your mother, or to me, her father? Ay, ay, I
see, young man, it is all self, self! <i>Mr. Lupton is very kind to me</i>&mdash;true&mdash;<i>to
me</i>, and that is enough.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, it is not enough,&rdquo; answered our hero. &ldquo;A great deal more must be
done, and may be done, if, to begin with, I can but make you and Mr.
Lupton friends.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>Friends!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Jerry&mdash;&ldquo;friends! Utter that word again,
sir&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I do; I repeat it,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;and I am not such a coward as to fear
that you will attempt to harm me, because I say that, both for my mother's
sake and your own, for Mr. Lupton's and mine, you must be friends.
Remember, if you have something to forgive him, he has a great deal to
forgive you also.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He something to forgive <i>me!</i> What is it? I suppose for having
spared him so long. But if I spare him much longer, may I never be
forgiven where I shall better want it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is but an hour or two ago,&rdquo; replied Colin, &ldquo;that I prevailed on him
not to raise the hue and cry after you until things could be better
explained, although you have twice attempted his life.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is that it? Is that his forgiveness? Then I hurl it back in his face, and
in yours, and tell him I want none of it! If he wants to take me let him,
and I will sit here till he comes. Fetch him, and let him try; and then,
if the third time does not do for all, I shall well deserve a gallows for
being such a bungler at my business.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;He has no desire to injure you at all,&rdquo; said Colin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How very kind of him!&rdquo; retorted Jerry, &ldquo;seeing how good he has been to my
only daughter, and how badly I have rewarded him for it!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you must know how much the law puts in his power.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I care neither for the law nor his power. My law is my own, and that I
shall abide by.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Not to prolong this dialogue, of which sufficient has been given to show
the character of the speakers, I shall merely observe, that Jerry Clink
concluded it by emphatically declaring, that never to the end of his life
should he, on any consideration whatever, give up this the great object
for which he lived, unless he was so far fortunate as to achieve it at an
earlier period; and this asseveration he ratified by all such infernal
powers as could conveniently be summed up into one long oathlike sentence,&mdash;a
sentence which it is not necessary here to repeat.
</p>
<p>
Finding all his efforts to overcome, or even to mollify, the desperate
determination of vengeance, which Jerry still so violently entertained,
altogether vain, Colin could not at the moment form in his own mind any
other conclusion than that which pointed out the propriety of securing
Jerry, in order to insure Mr. Lupton's personal safety. This, however,
from the inevitable consequences which must follow, was a step on the
brink of which he hesitated, and from which he turned with horror. Was
there no way by which to avoid the dreadful necessity of involving his own
mother's parent in the pains of a fearful criminal law?&mdash;to her
lasting shame and grief, and his own as lasting sorrow and regret. How
devoutly in his heart did he wish that he could be a peace-maker, an
allayer of bad passions, a reconciler of those whose own evils had brought
them into this depth of trouble! Then, indeed, all might be well; or at
least so far well, as any ending may be which comes of so sad a beginning;
for he felt that, after the painful disclosures which had that morning
been made to him, the brightest light of his future life was dimmed, and
the most he could hope for was to go through existence under those subdued
feelings of enjoyment which ever result from the consciousness of evils
past, and for ever irremediable.
</p>
<p>
Still he clung to the hope that the old man's violence might be mitigated,
as he became more familiar with the thoughts of reconciliation, of
atonement being made to his daughter, and as the kindness of Mr. Lupton to
himself should be rendered more evident.
</p>
<p>
The agitation and excitement of his mind, consequent on these and similar
reflections, caused him for the time almost to forget the object he had in
view with respect to the imprisoned James Woodruff. Before, however, their
present interview terminated, Colin again alluded to the subject, and
requested at least to be informed by what singular chance of fortune it
could have happened that the unfortunate gentleman alluded to could
possibly have been confided to the keeping of Jerry Clink.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, as to that,&rdquo; replied Jerry, &ldquo;I 've no particular objection to tell
you, and then you 'll believe me; but mind, I shall go no farther. Don't
inquire whether he is likely to be dead or alive next week,&mdash;where he
is, or anything else about him. I clap that injunction on you beforehand.
As to the other part of the business, it happened this way. If you 've any
memory, you'll remember that night I jumped out o' the window at Kiddal
Hall, when, but for <i>your</i> meddling, I should have brought down my
game without twice loading. Well, I got into the woods safe enough; but,
knowing the place would be a deal too hot to hold me for a while, I next
day went clandestinely off into a different part of the country, in order
to make safe. I partly changed my dress and name, and at last pitched my
tent under a rock in a solitary part of Sherwood Forest, where I never saw
a man, and no man saw me for weeks together. However, as I gathered ling
for making besoms, and carried them about the surrounding country, I got
to be pretty well known; and, amongst the rest, I fell in with a Mr.
Rowel, who lived on the edge of the waste, and who behaved very well to
me. Well, one day he came down to my rock-hole, and told me he wanted me
to take a madman under my keeping, who had been brought to his house by
his brother, and whom they wanted, for very particular reasons, to get out
of the way. 'Well, well,' said I to him, 'bring him down: I care for
neither a madman nor the devil, and can manage either when occasion calls.
They accordingly brought him, tied hand and foot and blindfolded, pitched
him into my place, and there I have had him ever since, and been well paid
for my trouble, or else I should not have been here. However, when the man
himself told me his story, I found he was not more mad, perhaps, than
those that sent him; and so, as your mother had told me all about your
part of the affair besides,&mdash;for <i>she</i> knew where I was gone to,&mdash;I
thought it a fair chance for making you do as a son ought to do, and
revenging her dishonour, when, perhaps, it did not lie so conveniently in
my power. But I am deceived in you altogether; and sooner than I 'll ask
anybody else again to do my business, may I be sunk to the lowest pit of
perdition! No, may I&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Say no more,&rdquo; observed Colin, interrupting him, &ldquo;but just answer me this&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; said Jerry, &ldquo;I clapped an injunction on you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; remarked Colin; &ldquo;I 'll ask no questions.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But he reflected within himself that the place of Jerry's abode would now
be no difficult thing to discover, and that, with a convenient force and
quiet management, it might readily be surprised, and Woodruff's liberation
be effected.
</p>
<p>
One thing more only did he now wish to be made acquainted with, for on
that depended the course he should at the present moment adopt with
respect to old Jerry himself. He wished to ascertain whether it was the
old man's intention to remain and lurk about the town, seeking
opportunities for gratifying his revenge, or to return at once to the
place whence he had come.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I shall not stay here,&rdquo; replied Jerry, &ldquo;for I can trust none of you; but
some time, when least it is expected, Mr. Lupton will find me by his
side.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Trusting to put Mr. Lupton effectually on his guard against immediate
danger, and hoping by his future proceedings ultimately to avert that
danger altogether, without any appeal to legal protection or to violence,
Colin concluded not to molest the old man at present.
</p>
<p>
Thus, then, he parted with Jerry, forming in his own mind, as he returned
townwards, a very ingenious scheme for countermining all the plans of
which Rowel and his brother had made Jerry Clink the instrument and
depositary.

<h2>
CHAPTER II.
</h2>
<p>
<i>In which Mr. Lupton explains to Colin the story of himself and his
lady.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN next Colin Clink met his father the Squire, it was under the
influence of such feelings of embarrassment as scarcely left him at
liberty to speak; while Mr. Lupton, on his part, received him with that
quiet melancholy, though unembarrassed air, which marked emphatically a
man upon whom the force of unhappy and unusual circumstances has produced
a subdued, though lasting, sense of dejection.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;For some time past,&rdquo; said he, taking Colin's hand, and conducting him to
a chair,&mdash;&ldquo;for some time past, my boy, I have felt that one day or
other it must come to this. Ever since the time when Providence so
singularly threw it in your power to save me from a violent end,&mdash;and
from <i>such a</i> hand too!&mdash;I have been a changed man. By that
event Heaven seemed to lay, as it were, a palpable finger upon my soul,
the dint of which is everlasting. That from such retributive justice, if
justice it could be called, I should have been so saved by one whose very
existence itself had called that justice into action, appears to me like a
marvellous lesson, in which Providence intended at once to admonish me of
my criminality, and at the same time to remind me of its mercy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Lupton here covered his eyes with his hand. In a few minutes he thus
continued,&mdash;&ldquo;From that moment I foresaw that, sooner or later, you
must know all. <i>Now</i> you do know all; and that knowledge has come to
you in such a shape, as to render any farther allusion to it needless. The
subject is at best a painful one to us both, but most especially so to me;
although I once held such things lightly, and as matter for pleasantry and
joke. I now acknowledge you as my son; and I confess that a proud, though
painful, time it is, now I can do so face to face. Save in yours and my
own, the blood of an ancient and honourable family runs in no human veins.
You are grown to manhood, and the circumstances which Providence has
brought about enable me to address you thus without impropriety. But you
must be told, my boy, that I was the last, the very last of all my race.
My father knew it; he lamented over it; but he cherished and guarded me
because of it, as though the world contained for him no other treasure. <i>I</i>
knew it too; I grew up, as I may say, side by side with that fatal
knowledge. With our ideas of long descents, and ancient honourable lines,
it is the bitterest thought in a man's breast to think that here the
stream must stop; that in this one body it is lost, and the sun shall
shine upon its name no longer. Anxiety for my life and welfare helped to
bring my father to the grave earlier than otherwise nature would have
called him, and he died while yet I was very young. But before he died he
bound me, on attaining my twenty-first year, to marry one of the members
of an opulent and numerous family, which had long enjoyed his esteem. I
did so, and the lady he had selected became my wife. There were
circumstances between Mrs. Lupton and myself which need not be explained,
but which, while they made her deem herself most unhappy in her fate, left
me not a whit less so in opinion of mine. It is sufficient that I say,
years passed on, and I was still the last. Beyond this I need not go. In
you, my boy, in you&mdash;but no, that need not to be said, either. Only
this I will and must say, that, under circumstances which the world
superficially may deem highly criminal, there may be hidden causes, and
feelings, and springs of action, which no heart knows but his that
contains them, and which, through the force of perhaps erroneous notions
and education from our youth, have become individually equally strong with
right principles, and may therefore possibly be in some sort received in
palliation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Colin was very materially concerned during, and affected at the conclusion
of, the above speech; although the author himself of this faithful history
cannot refrain from expressing his opinion, that its tenor and tendency
seem somewhat inconsistent with Mr. Lupton's apparent neglect of Colin
during the early part of his life, and savours more of a plausible attempt
to excuse himself, than of a plain exposition of real motives. Possibly,
however, by suspending judgment a while, both himself and the reader may
on this point become a little wiser before this history be brought to a
termination.
</p>
<p>
For the present, we may continue this scene a few moments longer.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;With regard to Mrs. Lupton,'&rdquo; continued the Squire, &ldquo;as I intend shortly
to introduce you to her, it may be as well to inform you beforehand, that
the satisfaction your presence in my house will give must not be judged
from <i>her</i> reception of you. What it may be I cannot foresee. I
cannot even judge what steps a woman in her situation may think proper to
take; but whatever they be, it is needful you should see her, and be
introduced to her as <i>the heir of Kiddal</i>, before she dies. Had she
acceded to my wishes years ago,&mdash;had we, as I desired, been divorced
before you were born, this present necessity and trouble would never have
come upon us; but that proceeding she resisted to the last. And though
there are circumstances pointed out by the laws which might place the
power of adopting such an alternative wholly in my own hands; yet, rather
than so deeply wound the feelings and destroy the future peace of a woman
who loved me, and whom I had loved, I have rather chosen to endure, to
pass years of unavailing regret, and come to this, even this, at last. I
have neglected her, it is true, partly in hopes of thereby inducing her to
give way, and partly because I had no heart to be a hypocrite. I never
could very well affect what I did not feel.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Lupton subsequently informed Colin, that although the lady of whom he
had been speaking had, during some years past, lived apart from him,
sometimes residing in town, and occasionally abroad, yet that very
recently she had expressed her desire and intention to return to the old
hall once more, and to pass the following winter there. On that occasion
it was purposed by him that Colin should meet her.
</p>
<p>
I should be doing a great injustice to Colin were I to disguise from the
reader the satisfaction which, notwithstanding all drawbacks, he could not
fail to feel from the, to him, magnificent prospects that Mr. Lupton's
discourse opened before him. To think that, from a poor and helpless
farmer's boy, he should thus suddenly and unexpectedly have risen, as it
were, to the rank of a squire's son, with the certainty of a great fortune
to be bestowed upon him, and such a fine old house as Kiddal Hall in which
to enjoy it, and to pass the remainder of his days! What a triumph, too,
did it not give him over all the paltry and tyrannical souls who about his
native place had made his life miserable, and even done as much as lay in
their power to hunt him out of existence.
</p>
<p>
These feelings were far less the result of vindictiveness than of that
just sense of retribution which may be said to exist in every honest
breast.
</p>
<p>
These matters being thus disposed of, Colin seized his opportunity to
re-introduce the question regarding old Jerry Clink.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;With respect to him,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lupton, &ldquo;though I am astonished to find
he is still alive, instead of hearing, as I had anticipated, that his body
had been picked up off Lime-house, I am too sensible of his feelings, and
the cause of them, to entertain against him any ideas of retaliation. My
own security is all I must provide for,&mdash;that I am bound to do; and,
so long as that can be insured, I shall take no farther notice of the
past. We have both been wrong already, and had better on both sides avoid
wronging each other any farther.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Colin expressed his hopes that, bad as matters now appeared to stand,
everything might yet be accommodated in a manner which would leave all
parties the happier for their forgiveness, and the wiser from the troubles
they had undergone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is hopeless,&rdquo; answered Mr. Lupton. &ldquo;The man whose sense of injury, and
determination to have revenge, can so vividly outlive the wear of so many
years, is not, I am afraid, of a sufficiently ductile metal to be ever
formed into a kinder shape. Unless some altogether unforeseen circumstance
should happily come between to reverse the present tendency of events, it
is to me a distinct and evident truth, that either that old man or I will
eventually prove the death of the other.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This opinion he uttered in such a serious and almost prophetical tone, as
left upon the mind of his hearer an impression which all his own most
sanguine hopes and predictions were insufficient to eradicate.

CHAPTER III.
</h2>
<p>
<i>Wherein Peter Veriquear makes love to Miss Sowersoft, and becomes
involved in trouble.&mdash;Mr. Palethorpe's reconciliation with his
mistress.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N pursuance of a design which Colin had secretly formed, involving a
journey to Sherwood forest, and the surprise of Jerry Clink's retreat, for
the carrying off of James Woodruff, he one afternoon might have been seen
wending his way towards his old quarters in Bethnal Green. The
co-operation of some one, a perfect stranger to Jerry, and in whose sense
and integrity entire confidence could be placed, was imperatively required
in its successful execution; and, in lack of a better man for the
business, Colin selected his old employer, Mr. Peter Veriquear, provided
that gentleman's known indifference towards other people's business could
by any possibility be overcome.
</p>
<p>
On arriving at his domicile, Colin found that Peter was from home, having
taken advantage of a fine day to convey his small family in the
cradle-coach to a favourite suburban retreat, for the enjoyment of tea and
toping, not far from the tower at Canonbury.
</p>
<p>
In this, and innumerable similar places about the environs of the
metropolis, it is that, on fine warm summer afternoons and evenings,
especially on Sundays, the shop-tired and <i>counter-sunk</i> inhabitants
of the respectable working classes assemble, ostensibly for the purpose of
imbibing what by common courtesy is dignified with the title of fresh air,
though in reality with equally as settled an intention of mixing the said
fresh air with bottled stout, three X ales, and a pipe or two of
bird's-eye. Here you may see the young lover anxiously endeavouring to
&ldquo;insinivate&rdquo; himself into the good graces of his sweetheart, by evincing
the most striking solicitude that she should soak up repeated bird-sips of
his cold &ldquo;blue-ruin.&rdquo; You may observe them&mdash;true lovers of twilight&mdash;getting
into the veriest back corner of arbour or bower, telling in security the
almost silent tale, that no ear may hear but theirs. Here, also, is seen
the young husband, with his wife following behind him, a &ldquo;pledge&rdquo; of
affection toddling by his side, and perhaps a &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; hugged
preciously up in his arms; while the empty-headed spark, who lives in
seeing and being seen, the gross and sensual guzzler of heavy wet, and the
old quiet smoker, whom nothing can move or elevate, make up this motley
assembly. Pots and glasses appear on every side, and busy waiters running
in all directions across the grass, with tray, or lantern, or glowing
piece of live touchwood, to light the pipes of the company.
</p>
<p>
As our hero entered the tavern and teagardens in question, he passed
beneath a low and long colonnade of a somewhat humble description, the top
of which was formed by the projection of the second story of the building.
Several miniature conveyances for the small aristocracy of the baby
generation stood about, and amongst them that identical one on which Colin
had himself once exercised his abilities, as previously described.
</p>
<p>
To the left hand lay a wide lawn, on which some score or two of youngsters
were disporting themselves in the twilight, while the &ldquo;parents and
guardians,&rdquo; as the newspapers say, of these small gentry were lolling at
their ease in certain cots, or arbours, made waterproof with pitch, which
bounded the sides of the green.
</p>
<p>
In one of these Colin soon found the individual of whom he was in search.
Having communicated to Peter some general idea that his assistance was
required in a very important enterprise.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Veriquear, &ldquo;it may be of great consequence to you; but
that, you know, is your own affair. It is no business of mine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you will be well rewarded by Mr. Woodruff afterwards, I doubt not,&rdquo;
 replied Colin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you think so? Oh, then, in that case, it begins to look more like my
own affair than I thought it was. Yes, yes; good pay, you know, always
makes a thing a man's business directly.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And hereupon the matter was discussed at leisure, and in a manner which
clearly proved that, upon sufficient reason given, Peter could take quite
as much interest in other people's business as ever he had taken in his
own.
</p>
<p>
While Colin thus sat in discourse with his old employer, his attention had
several times been partially attracted by a voice in the next adjoining
arbour, but which now elevated itself to a distinctly audible pitch in the
expression of the following sentiment:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Upon my word, those little dears are delightful to look on! The
satisfaction of having children to bring up&mdash;ay, dear!&mdash;the
pleasure and delight, Mr. Palethorpe, of leading them as it were by the
nose, symbolically speaking:&mdash;oh! the delight of it must be&mdash;must
be&mdash;I hardly know what to call it&mdash;but something which, in an
unmarried state, the imagination can scarcely attempt to soar up to. And
then their tiny voices&mdash;some ill-tempered people may call it
squealing if they please&mdash;but to a father's ears, I should think, it
must be welcome night and day,&mdash;that is, if he has the common
feelings of a father about him. It is really astonishing how happy some
people might be, if they did but take something of a determination at some
time or other of their lives to adopt some course with respect to somebody
or other, which might&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;might&mdash;might&mdash;however,
I mean, which might lead to something final and decisive.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sartinly, meesis,&rdquo; replied the individual thus addressed, &ldquo;I don't
dispoot all that; only, when a man has a good appetite hisself, and can
eat most of what's put before him, it seems natteral enough that his
children would go and do the same; and that would take a little more
mainteaning than some of us can exactly afford. I can't see myself how <i>we</i>
could go all that length, with a proper eye to our own old age.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied the lady, &ldquo;there it is! I really think there is not a grain
of filial feeling left in any farmer in Yorkshire.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm sure, meesis,&rdquo; rejoined Palethorpe, &ldquo;you 'll not accuse me of wanting
in filly-al feeling, when you know there isn't a single filly nor colt
neither on the whole farm as I haven't showed the&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I don't mean that!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady; &ldquo;you don't understand me. But I
can only say it for myself, that it would be no great trouble to me, not a
bit of it, to sink the whole of myself in the endeavour to raise a prodigy
of children, that should prove a complete honour to any farm-yard in the
riding. The pretty dears! how I should spoil them out of kindness!&mdash;yes,
that I should&mdash;I know I should. Ugh! I could squeeze their little
hearts to pieces, I could!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This rhapsody left Colin no longer in the dark. Mr. Palethorpe was again
in London, accompanied by the loving and amiable Miss Sowersoft.
</p>
<p>
A capital idea at this moment struck Colin's mind. Mr. Peter Veriquear was
already well acquainted with the story of Palethorpe's previous visit to
town, and had applauded Colin for the part he had then taken in punishing
that poor booby as he deserved. He therefore now only required to be
informed that both Palethorpe and his mistress were in the next box, in
order, as Colin hoped, to be induced to join him in an innocent trick upon
the worthy couple. His proposition was simply this,&mdash;that Peter
should quietly walk into their arbour, sit down next to Miss Sower-soft,
call for drink, as though he had just arrived, and then proceed, according
to the best of his ability, in making love to that lady, no less to her
own eventual disappointment, than to the annoyance and mortification of
the redoubtable Samuel. Veriquear laughed at the notion, but objected that
to make love to a lady in that manner could not possibly be any business
of his, seeing, in the first place, that he had no desire; in the second,
that he was married; and in the third, that possibly he might after all
come off the worst for it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;what will Mrs. Veriquear say if she should happen to
catch me, for I expect her up to tea here very soon; and if she <i>should</i>
come before the joke is completed, I am afraid she would turn it into a
regular Whitechapel tragedy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, never heed that!&rdquo; replied Colin. &ldquo;I 'll be bound to see you safe, and
all right. Go in directly, and do it before the chance be lost. Here,
waiter!&rdquo; and he whispered to him to carry a bottle of stout into the next
box for his friend, without delay.
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes more Peter Veriquear was sitting beside Miss Sowersoft,
while Colin peeped through a nick in the boards which divided the two
boxes, and with high glee observed all that passed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A fine evening this, ma'am,&rdquo; said Peter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Delightful evening, indeed, sir!&rdquo; echoed Miss Sowersoft.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yees, it 's pleasant,&rdquo; added Palethorpe, who remembered his former
exploits, and began to fear a thief; at the same time that he thought it
the most advisable course at present to speak civilly to him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Admirable places these,&rdquo; continued Peter, &ldquo;for the enjoyment of the
working-people, who are confined in shops and warehouses from week's end
to week's end.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;They are, indeed,&rdquo; said Miss Sowersoft.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; added Palethorpe.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And, really,&rdquo; continued the lady, &ldquo;I had not the most remote conception
that such places existed. It is positively like a private gentleman's
private grounds.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Uncommon like,&rdquo; repeated Palethorpe. &ldquo;Then you are strangers here,
ma'am?&rdquo; asked Peter.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Quite so, sir!&rdquo; answered the lady. &ldquo;We have only been up a few days.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I ar'n't a stranger, though,&rdquo; protested Palethorpe; &ldquo;I've bin afore, and
know what's what as well as most folks. He'd be a sharper chap than
somebody that I see to drop on us.&rdquo; Miss Sowersoft here gave Palethorpe a
nudge with her foot, and squeezed her brows and mouth up at him into a
very severe expression of reprehension. At the same time Colin poked a
sharp toothpick between the boards against which his back leaned, and
inserted it about the tenth of an inch deep into Pale-thorpe. The varlet
jumped, as, thinking he had hitched upon a nail; and, having looked under
him without finding anything, sat down again a little farther off. In the
mean time Peter looked very graciously at the lady, who seemed by no means
displeased with his attentions, and continued a conversation, in which he
prognosticated how many marvellous sights she would see in London, and how
much she would be delighted before her return: concluding with an obscure
hint that it would give him much pleasure, should he at any time chance to
meet with her again, to point out the objects best worthy a stranger's
attention. Miss Sowersoft smirked benignantly, and glanced at Palethorpe
with an expression which seemed to say that &ldquo;somebody might now see that
everybody did not think so little of somebody else, as some people were
apt to imagine,&rdquo; while Palethorpe himself grew paler, and verily began to
think that his &ldquo;meesis&rdquo; was going to be taken, without farther ceremony,
altogether out of his hands. He fidgeted about on his seat, as though bent
on polishing his breeches, like a tabletop; while another poke of the
toothpick, twice as deep as before, made him fairly cry out, and curse the
joiner who had put up, the benches without knocking his nails down.
</p>
<p>
Encouraged by his success, Peter so far increased his attentions as at
length fairly to arouse: the jealousy of Mr. Palethorpe, who resented the
insult thus put upon him by declaring that as that lady was keeping
company with himself, nobody else should speak to her so long as he was
by, or else his name was not Palethorpe. To which valiant speech Miss
Sowersoft herself replied by informing, her farming-man that he was one of
those kind of people who seemed as if they could neither make up their own
minds to come to a decisive point themselves, nor endure to see anybody
else do the same. A sentiment which Mr. Veriquear rendered still more
strikingly illustrative by declaring that the gentleman who sat opposite
him was like one of those ill-tempered curs, that turn up their own noses
at a bone, but grumble and snarl at every other dog that attempts to touch
it.

<h4>
<a href="images/051.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
Finding even his own &ldquo;meesis&rdquo; against him, Palethorpe's mettle began to
rise, and he demanded to know whether Mr. Veriquear meant to call him a
cur? To which Veriquear replied, that he would look still more like one if
he went upon all-fours. Hereupon Mr. Palethorpe challenged his antagonist
to a boxing-match upon the green, swearing that he would lick him as clean
as ever any man was licked in this world, or be d&mdash;&mdash;d for his
trouble. Peter ridiculed this threat, and begged the courageous gentleman
who made it to recollect that he was not now in Yorkshire; informing him
still further that if he did not take particular care, he would lay
himself under the unpleasant necessity of making another appearance at the
police-office, as he had done upon a former occasion. Mr. Palethorpe
turned pale on hearing this; while Miss Sowersoft seemed literally
astounded, as she demanded in a shrill and faint, but earnest voice,
whether he (Mr. Veriquear) <i>knew</i> Mr. Palethorpe and his calamity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Everybody in London knows him,&rdquo; replied Veriquear; &ldquo;and I can assure you,
ma'am, that it is no credit to any respectable female to be seen with a
man who has rendered himself so disgracefully notorious.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Afraid that she had committed herself in the eyes of all the people of the
metropolis, Miss Sowersoft looked upon the unlucky Palethorpe at the
moment almost with horror; at the same time unconsciously and
instinctively she clung for support to the strange hand of that poor man's
supposed rival. At this interesting and peculiarly striking part of the
scene, Mrs. Peter Veriquear (directed by Master William, whom she had
picked up on the lawn) bounced suddenly into the box.
</p>
<p>
Colin, whose business it was to have prevented this surprise by keeping a
good look-out for the arrival of the last-named lady, had been so deeply
engaged in spying through a little round hole, which he had made by
pushing a knot out of one of the boards, and had found himself so mightily
entertained with the scene before him, that the sudden apparition-like
appearance of Mrs. Veriquear almost confounded him; and especially when,
in the next moment, he beheld that lady, who instantly detected her
husband's situation, dart like a fury at Miss Sowersoft, whom she
concluded had seduced him, and pommel away with her fists as might some
belated baker, who has the largest amount of dough to knead up within the
least possible given space of time. Palethorpe and Veriquear were
instantly up in arms&mdash;the latter endeavouring to restrain his wife,
and the former, with a degree of chivalrous feeling entirely peculiar to
himself, striking her with brutal force upon the head and face; while
Master William Veriquear, seeing the imminent danger of his worthy
parents, struck up a solo in the highest possible key, upon the natural
pipes with which he was provided for such occasions.
</p>
<p>
No sooner did Colin perceive the dastardly conduct of Palethorpe, than he
forsook his situation at the peep-hole, and hurrying to the spot, laid his
old foe, the farming-man, flat upon the floor with a well-directed blow of
the fist. The latter looked up from his inglorious situation; and if ever
man felt convinced that he was haunted by an evil genius, Mr. Palethorpe
felt so on this occasion, and that <i>his</i> evil genius was embodied in
the form of Colin Clink.
</p>
<p>
A regular mêlée now ensued, during which Mrs. Veriquear's cap was sent
flying into the air, like a boy's balloon. The back of the arbour was
driven out, and Mr. Veriquear, locked in the arms of Miss Sowersoft, fell
through the opening into that beautiful and refreshing piece of water
which has its local habitation opposite the west side of Canon-bury Tower.
</p>
<p>
The sudden appearance of several policemen amongst the combatants put an
end to the sport. Colin and Palethorpe were seized, and attempted to be
hurried off; but as neither had any very particular reason for desiring a
situation in the watch-house, followed by an appearance before the
magistrates, they contrived so far to accommodate matters with the
guardians of the public peace as to be allowed to go at liberty, and each
his several way.
</p>
<p>
Colin's first step was to see to the safety of his friend, Veriquear. He
and Miss Sower-soft had already been fished out of the pond without rod,
line, or net, by the surrounding spectators, and now stood upon the bank,
like a triton and a mermaid just emerged from their palaces under the
flood. The latter-named of the two was conveyed into the tavern, and put
to bed, while the former was induced, at the representations of Colin, to
walk rapidly home with the enraged Mrs. Veriquear on his arm. Colin
himself undertaking the charge of the young Veriquears, and drawing them
down in the basket-coach at some short distance behind.
</p>
<p>
Peter Veriquear naturally enough employed the whole time occupied in their
journey home by explaining to his spouse the origin, decline, and fall, of
the history of this adventure. A statement which Colin afterwards so far
corroborated as to leave Mrs. Veriquear entirely convinced, not only of
her husband's innocence of any criminal intention, but satisfied that a
capital practical joke had been played upon two individuals most richly
deserving of it.
</p>
<p>
As to the unexpected appearance of the worthy couple in town within so
comparatively short a time of Mr. Palethorpe's former inglorious
expedition, it is to be accounted for upon the same principle as are many
other matters of equal importance: that is, according to a certain
principle of curiosity, which is supposed to exist pretty largely in every
human breast, but especially in the bosoms of the fair. And although,
strictly speaking, Miss Sowersoft could not be termed one of the fair
either in her complexion or her dealings, yet she so far came under that
category touching the article of curiosity, that I much doubt whether Dame
Nature ever was blessed with another daughter in whom this virtue shone
more conspicuously.
</p>
<p>
During the first day or two after her discovery of Palethorpe's frail and
erring nature, she betook herself, as far as the duties of the farm would
allow, to the silence and solitude of her own bed-chamber; where, in all
human probability, she wept over the depravity of human nature, and
scattered the flowers of a gloomy imagination about the corpse of all her
blighted hopes. Several times was she seen with a white handkerchief
applied to her eyes. For some weeks Mr. Palethorpe lived as though he
lived not. To her, at least, he was dead: she saw him not, heard him not,
knew him not. When he spoke his voice passed her by like the wind: when he
whistled she heeded it no more than the whistling of a keyhole; when he
laughed,&mdash;if ever he ventured to laugh,&mdash;she heard no mirth in
the sound: when he cried,&mdash;if ever he did cry, which I very much
doubt,&mdash;she participated not in his sorrows: and when, as very often
happened, he sat still, and did nothing at all, then&mdash;then only, did
he come up to her ideas of him, and appear (if such a thing can be
conceived by the ingenious reader) an embodied nonentity. Meantime
Palethorpe ate and drank at random, and unheeded. A feeling of desperation
seemed to govern all his herbivorous and carnivorous propensities. While
Miss Sowersoft pined, Palethorpe evidently grew fatter; while she stalked
like a ghost, he grew redder and more robust. The contrast, at length,
became unendurable; and from mere envy and spite she at last began to
speak to him again.
</p>
<p>
From a sullen and sulky exchange of words, this happy pair at length
proceeded to a certain reluctant but animated discourse, in which
explanation, reproaches, and deprecation, were abundantly resorted to. She
accused; he apologized and regretted, and then, at length, she forgave;
and Mr. Palethorpe once more had the satisfaction of finding himself
restored to tolerable favour.
</p>
<p>
I have said that Miss Sowersoft's curiosity was extreme. When Palethorpe
detailed to her all the wonders of his expedition, her propensity could
not be restrained. She, too, must see London. Besides, to tell the truth,
her reconcilement sat but awkwardly upon even her own shoulders at first;
and, like an ill-fitted saddle on a steed, only galled the creature it was
intended to relieve. She secretly thought a journey abroad in Palethorpe's
company could not fail mightily to facilitate her plan of achieving his
final conquest, for, in spite of all errors, she felt that his name must
some day become her own, or she should die. Accordingly, the pleasure-tour
to town was at last agreed upon, and hence their appearance again at the
time and place in question.
</p>
<p>
Returning to Colin, it may now be stated, that before he took his
departure from Mr. Veriquear's that evening, a plan was arranged between
himself and Peter for carrying his first and most important design into
immediate execution.

CHAPTER IV.
</h2>
<p>
<i>Introduces certain new characters upon the stage, and amongst them the
real heroine of this history. Besides containing a love-story far superior
to the last.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>UT while the delightful loves of Miss Sower soft and Mr. Palethorpe yet
leave their tender impress on the mind, and predispose the susceptible
soul of my romantic reader for the reception of tales of gallantry and
devoted affection, let me take advantage of the favourable opportunity
thus afforded by the condition of his heart, to make mention of another
delicate matter which, up to this time, has been making some progress in
reality, although not the remotest allusion hitherto has been made to it.
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding the little real or supposed amours in which Colin has
previously been engaged, and the last of which so nearly, in his own
opinion, made shipwreck of his heart, it must have been evident that the
opportunity which promised the most proper and appropriate match for him
had not yet arrived. Towards Fanny, it is true, he had never in this sense
entertained any feelings of love, nor had he ever professed any. On Fanny
herself lay all the pain and bitterness of having secretly nourished an
affection for one who was insensible of it, and on whom, as it now pretty
clearly appeared, her heart had been set in vain. While, with respect to
Miss Wintlebury, not only had she herself declined his company, and
withdrawn from his knowledge, but the advice of his father, Mr. Lupton,
combined most strongly with other circumstances to persuade him that even
had it not been thus, he would but be paying due deference to his
protector in considering more seriously upon the subject before he
ventured to carry his communications with that young woman any farther.
The reflections moreover that arose in his mind touching the very altered
circumstances in which he was placed by Mr. Lupton, as well as the
prospects which now through that gentleman opened upon his future life,
could scarcely fail very materially to influence even him in his decisions
upon this important point. But Miss Wintlebury being voluntarily withdrawn
from him, and Fanny being made aware that he loved her only as a friend,
and reconciled he hoped, too, to that knowledge,&mdash;what considerations
of any importance remained to prevent his forming some such other alliance
as might at once prove suitable to his expected future fortunes and rank
as a country gentleman, as well as agreeable to the wishes and advice of
him by whom those fortunes and rank were to be conferred, and whom, on
other accounts, he was bound to endeavour to please?
</p>
<p>
While in this state of mental uncertainty, Mr. Lupton had taken an
opportunity of introducing him to the acquaintance of one Mr. Henry
Calvert, a gentleman of comfortable, though not large, fortune, residing
in one of the northern suburbs of London, and in whose family he soon
found,&mdash;as his father had secretly desired,&mdash;a companion very
much after the heart of any young man of true sense and sensibility. This
was in the person of Jane Calvert, the youngest of two sisters, and a lady
within a year or two of his own age. Well-educated, sensible, and
good-tempered, she was one of those creatures who, as they grow up to
womanhood, and all its nameless witcheries, become unconsciously, as it
were, the life and light of the household;&mdash;to whom parents,
brothers, and sisters,&mdash;all instinctively and unknown, perhaps, to
themselves,&mdash;look up as the soul of the family;&mdash;whom all love&mdash;none
envy; whose presence, in a manner, makes glad, none know why; as the
spring delights us unthought on, or the flowers by our way-side inspire
pleasure and gratification even when least we know whence our elasticity
of spirit is derived. She was one of those happy beings&mdash;the heart,
as it were, of the domestic circle&mdash;that would be most missed if
taken away; that would leave the longest empty place in the bosoms of
those who had surrounded her; but who, in many things, was least felt
while present, save in the quiet and gentle sense of unobtrusive happiness
which her presence ever occasioned. Such was the character of the young
lady with whom it may now be said Colin was indeed in love. Below him in
height, she yet was sufficiently tall to give dignity to an elegant
figure; while a light and brilliant complexion, associated, as it usually
is, with hair and eyes of a hue which the pencil of nature colours in
admirable correspondence, but which in words can scarcely be properly
described, gave no fairer a representation exteriorly than the jewel of a
soul within most amply deserved.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Jane, who had seen Colin at her father's house but on
few occasions before, now, for the first time in her existence, became
conscious that, happy as she was, she might be yet happier in a sphere of
which hitherto she had thought nothing, and under circumstances which,
even when alone, she scarcely suffered herself to contemplate. Up to this
time she had never dreamed of love beyond the circle of her own family:
now she felt that loveable and good creatures exist beyond in the wide
world, whom to see is to remember, and to remember is to regret their
absence. She found that the heart is capable of other love than that of
parents, sisters, and brothers: and not capable only, but that such may
become too deeply necessary to its happiness, ever again&mdash;after once
making that discovery&mdash;to be truly happy without it.
</p>
<p>
Her father and family lived in that quiet and learned retirement which
neither sought nor invited, as they did not require, the excitement of
continual company, to enable them to get through life without weariness. A
tasteful and elegant, though simple, home afforded to them far higher
pleasures than all the genteel riot and conventional affectations of
happiness which occupy so much of the time and attention of the great body
of that class of society to which they belonged, and in which they might
have shone so gracefully conspicuous. But Mr. Calvert the father was too
much a man of mind to precipitate either himself or his family into the
whirl and eddy of what may be termed fashionable life. At the risk of
being thought dull and spiritless,&mdash;of having his daughters
neglected, and his sons regarded as &ldquo;very unlike what one naturally
expects young men would be,&rdquo;&mdash;he preferred to all other pleasures
that sound moral and mental education of his children,&mdash;that social,
or domestic, training of them up, and that quiet and pleasing attention to
the whole economy of his estate, and of all who were on it, which,
whatever its defects in the eyes of the world, never fails to produce the
greatest amount of real happiness to the possessors, as well as to render
them the most capable of becoming the sources of greatest happiness to
others. Hence, his daughters had never been presented a dozen times, if
not ostensibly, at least virtually, like bills for acceptance, but to be
refused. Neither had his two sons&mdash;for two he had&mdash;any knowledge
of those peculiar vices which, though they might have added to their
character as young men of spirit, could not by any means have done them
credit on any other account.
</p>
<p>
Besides their own mutual stores of ever fresh mental enjoyment, this happy
and well-judging little family found abundant recreation in a large and
admirable library, which Mr. Calvert had himself selected: as well as
amusement in an old-fashioned garden of extensive dimensions which
enclosed the house on three sides, and overshadowed the roof with its tall
elm trees,&mdash;planted there perhaps in the days of Addison; and which
threw a quiet secluded air over the whole scene. Mr. Calvert's taste,
indeed, was so far that of the time to which I have alluded, that Miss
Jenny had been so christened after some favourite in the <i>Spectator</i>;
while the eldest son Roger had, in like manner, received his cognomen
though his father's veneration at once for the genius of Addison and his
admiration of the character of Sir Roger de Coverley. When Jane once
jerked her pincushion into the pond, he reminded her of some tale of a
watch being similarly dealt by, as told in his favourite book; and not
unfrequently spoke of that particular age of British literature as one in
which he should have been most happy if it had been his fortune to live.
</p>
<p>
With such a man, and in a family with such an attraction in it as the one
I have before described, it is not to be wondered at that Colin soon found
himself happier than ever he could have believed. His own good looks and
love of learning recommended him, while the natural powers of his mind
carried him through, where else, perhaps, his previous want of habitual
intercourse with similar society might have exposed him to inevitable
annoyances.
</p>
<p>
Happiness, however, and especially in love, seems to have been considered
in the economy of human nature,&mdash;like the sun-light in the world,&mdash;as
too bright to endure without intervals of darkness and of shade. Not long
had Colin and Jane Calvert been thus acquainted,&mdash;they had just
learned to speak confidingly, and to breathe to each other those thoughts
which before had only trembled on the lips and been stifled in the
utterance,&mdash;when Colin was astonished and surprised to find in the
behaviour of Mr. Calvert a marked and strong difference from that which
hitherto he had pursued towards him. It was not essentially less kind than
before, but seemed more marked by regret than by offence; as though the
bosom in which it originated felt like that of a friend who secretly knows
that he must part,&mdash;not that he would, or wished to do so. Jane, too,
seemed downcast; but her regret spoke in her eyes, not words: in long
painful suspenses of thought, as it seemed,&mdash;though in reality in
deep worlds of thought traced out in the brain until they seemed to have
no end. And then sometimes, when her father, or her mother, or brother, or
sister, chanced to catch a momentary glance of her countenance,&mdash;they
would find those pretty eyes wet, as if the little well-spring within <i>would</i>
come to the top and overflow in spite of her. Did they ask her what was
the matter, she smiled without feeling, and replied,&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But instantly she would leave the room and go alone to her own chamber;
thus telling it was something, though a something not to be told. And
little do I know of human nature if, when there, those tears, denied
innocently by the tongue a moment before, did not fall rapidly as she
clasped her hands over a little bible which lay on a white cushion by her
bedside, and prayed voicelessly that she, and he she loved, might yet be
happy.
</p>
<p>
These things, it was observed by Colin, first occurred some short time
after Mr. Lup-ton and Mr. Calvert had had an interview of several hours'
duration in a private room; and during which, he now felt little doubt,
the question of the possible future union of the young people had been
seriously discussed.
</p>
<p>
Still it was not easy for him to imagine the cause of this strange
difference; nor could he for a while arrive at any explanation from either
party at all satisfactory on the subject. All that he knew was, that
nearly the whole family, with the exception principally of Mr. Roger
Calvert, even Jane herself,&mdash;and that was worst of all,&mdash;conducted
themselves towards him in a manner which left little doubt upon his mind
that some strong cause or other was in operation; which, in their eyes at
least, appeared to render the continuance of his acquaintance with the
young lady in question unadvisable, and a course to be decidedly avoided.
Still there was no harshness,&mdash;no decided neglect, no offensive
carriage, from any party. The feeling seemed to be that Jane should
decline his acquaintance as gradually and as kindly as possible,&mdash;but
that declined somehow it must be, and forgotten and given up for ever must
be the affection, the deep affection, I may properly say, he had conceived
for that excellent young creature. One day, however, as he was rambling
amongst the shrubberies with Roger Calvert, the most blunt and
open-hearted friend he had in the family, Colin mentioned the subject to
him, and ventured to ask plainly what was the real cause of this coldness
towards him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied Roger, &ldquo;I am not doing exactly right by telling you;
though, for my own part, I think you ought to know. But since you have so
plainly required me to name the reason, I will do so. Mark, however,
beforehand, that I do not agree with my father and mother in their opinion
about the matter,&mdash;I hold that whatever may be said in the Old
Testament, it is not Christian of us&mdash;it is not our duty&mdash;nor do
I see how we can justly do it,&mdash;to visit the sins of the fathers upon
the children.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Conviction flashed on Colin's mind like a burst of light. His cheeks
became pale and then red, while he would have burst into tears had not his
pride of heart forbidden him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; continued Roger on observing his emotion, &ldquo;that I did not
know whether it was right or not to tell you; but as you wanted to know,
and I am no keeper of secrets, it is no blame of mine. Frankly, I tell you
it is all owing to the story of your birth, which your father told to mine
some days ago together with all the rest of what he meant to do for you,
in order that there might be no misunderstanding afterwards between the
families. My father and mother, indeed the whole family, like you
uncommonly well; and as for myself, I think you a regularly good-hearted
fellow, and should have no objection any day to make the second at your
wedding with Jenny; but then their rigid and straitened notions are not
mine, although I have on several occasions told them just as plainly as I
am talking to you now, that they and I are by no means alike in opinion. I
can assure you it is nothing else; for though in fact such a match would
be quite equal to anything Jane could ever expect, if not greater, as Mr.
Lupton volunteered to make a will in your favour, as well as to give you a
handsome fortune down before the marriage, yet with them, especially with
my mother, it is a sort of matter of conscience which they do not seem at
present as if they could overcome. It is the source of much grief to them,
that I can tell you; and especially as Jane seems to have taken such a
liking to you: but then, you see&mdash;however, I can only say this,&mdash;and
I am her brother, and would not see a hair of her head touched, nor a lash
of her eye wet unnecessarily,&mdash;no, not for the best man in England!
but this I promise you, that if <i>I</i> were in your place and in love
with any young person that I cared anything particular about, I would make
up my mind to have her, and have her I would, let anybody, either man or
woman, say or do whatever they liked! That is my spirit,&mdash;though I
should not have told you so if I had not cared something about you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In this strange speech Colin saw at once the bitter cause of all his fear,
combined most oddly with something which yet inspired him with hope.
Surely he could not altogether fail, with perseverance, and the assistance
(to begin with) of such a spirited auxiliary as Roger Calvert had thus
proved himself likely to be.
</p>
<p>
That same night,&mdash;as he was upon the eve of his departure for
Sherwood forest, on the doubtful expedition for the liberation of James
Woodruff, Colin desired and obtained an interview with the young lady. It
was after a very early meal&mdash;about eight o'clock in the evening&mdash;when
they walked out along that portion of the garden which lay immediately in
view of the front of Mr. Calvert's house. It was a soft mellow autumnal
night,&mdash;the air was still and warm; the leaves were scattered
abundantly on the paths by some rude by-gone blast, and now lay in drifted
heaps along the edges of the grass-plots and under every sheltered corner;
while an increasing moon, that gave just light enough to keep darkness out
of the sky and total blackness from the earth, seemed to sail, like a
forsaken wreck, amongst the white and billowy clouds that overspread the
sky. Jane leaned more fondly, he thought, upon his arm than ever before;
and during some minutes they paced to and fro, without either of them
venturing to speak to the other those words which at best must have been
as it were but the preface to trouble. This silence lay heavy on each
heart, and yet each feared to break it. The first word would sound like a
parting knell, and neither felt courage to utter it. Still they walked up
and down; until at length that meaning and eloquent silence, which was at
first painful, became insupportable. Suddenly Colin stopped in his path,
laid his hand earnestly upon the arm of his companion, and bent his face
earthward, as he said, &ldquo;Young lady, there is no farther occasion for
disguise or secrecy on the part of yourself and your family. I know it
all, now. We must part!&mdash;that is fixed!&mdash;Part once more, and for
ever! For myself, as I know myself, and that whatever evil may be supposed
to attach to others, <i>I</i>, at least, have not individually deserved
this,&mdash;it is contrary to my nature to endure unkindness undeserved. I
am thought unworthy of you, and am treated as though I were; but I will
not in reality render myself so, by acting a mean and cowardly part; by
pressing my acquaintance where it is not desired, and persisting in those
attentions which even she, to whom they are offered,&mdash;even <i>she</i>,
thinks proper to reject.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no, do not say so!&rdquo; exclaimed his companion. &ldquo;It is not so, indeed,&mdash;it
is not, indeed!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I speak,&rdquo; replied Colin, &ldquo;only from what I have seen and experienced. I
<i>have</i> loved you,&mdash;I <i>do</i> love you! And, for the rest, you
know that as well as I.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;In truth, sir,&rdquo; answered Miss Calvert, &ldquo;I know nothing whatever of the
cause of all this. A few days ago only, I thought we were <i>so</i> happy!
And now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
A flood of tears here told, in the most pitiful of all languages, the
difference between that time and the present.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You know nothing of it?&rdquo; demanded Colin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, I assure you,&rdquo; answered his companion.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then, why,&rdquo; asked he,&mdash;&ldquo;why do worse than even others did, and shun
me without knowing why?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Because my father and mother, both,&rdquo; sobbed the lady, &ldquo;told me that it
would be better we should not love each other, and that I must try to
forget you!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you will do so?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I must try,&mdash;I must do so,&mdash;for it is my duty.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But will you,&mdash;can you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if you love me, do not ask me! I ought not to say it,&mdash;perhaps I
may. If it must be so, I hope I may; but I feel,&mdash;yes, my&mdash;my
dear Colin,&mdash;I feel that what they demand of me is impossible. I can
never banish you from my bosom,&mdash;never! No, not if they would give me
the world!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
If ever the reader of this history have been in love, he or she must be
perfectly well aware that a climax of feeling of the kind above described
is not arrived at without involving ulterior consequences, which
philosophers and grammarians have agreed to designate by the verb to kiss.
It must therefore be understood, that no sooner had the young lady
expressed the sentiments last recorded, than Colin, with becoming
alacrity, converted that verb into a substantive or noun,&mdash;i.e, into
&ldquo;anything which exists, or of which we have any notion,&rdquo;&mdash;by saluting
her upon the cheek in very becoming and gentlemanly style. This delicate
experiment had never been tried between them before; but, I am happy to be
able to record that it perfectly succeeded. Declarations of eternal
attachment were afterwards repeated on both sides, and vows of love made,
such as the Lady Diana, who was listening from behind a cloud over their
heads, hath seldom heard excelled; but which, as a man of honour, I feel
bound never to reveal to the public at large. Be it sufficient for the
reader to know, that Colin and Jane eventually tore themselves asunder,
with the final understanding that neither would ever love another so long&mdash;(as
some wonderful poet writes)&mdash;as the sun continued to shine, the
rivers to flow, or the seasons to revolve. This, to be sure, was promising
long enough beforehand, but then, being the usual language of love, as
found in the works of eminent authors, I&mdash;an humble imitator&mdash;am
in duty bound to make use of it.
</p>
<p>
The mental excitement produced by this interview, and the reflections
consequent upon it, had the effect of entirely preventing Colin from
taking his accustomed rest on retiring to his chamber. He, therefore,
endeavoured to wile away an hour or two in reading; and for that purpose
straightway established himself in an old-fashioned arm-chair by the
fire-place.
</p>
<p>
Having nearly sat out his exhausted lamp, Colin retired to an unenticing
couch, and passed the greater part of the night in the most anxious
reflections.

CHAPTER V.
</h2>
<p>
<i>Relates one of the best adventures in which Colin Clink has yet
signalised himself.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE sun was already setting behind the rising grounds which marked the
westward extreme of Sherwood forest; long lines of variously-coloured
cloud, like far-off promontories jutting into seas of gold and silver,
marked the place of his decline, when Jerry Clink, silent and alone, might
have been seen sitting on a turfen bench by the doorway of a sort of half
hut, half cavern, which lay in a small dell in the heart of the waste, far
below those horizontal lines of light that now only tinged the
heath-covered tops of the higher hills, or brought out in ghostly relief
the scattered and tempest-worn oaks which stood like skeletons far aloof
around. By his side stood an earthen pitcher containing his favourite
compound, and out of his mouth ascended in peaceful spires the smoke of
the immortal herb; while beside him, piled against the wall, lay a heap of
bright purple ling or heath, which he had cut and gathered during the day.
The old man looked the very personification of solitary enjoyment; a being
whose only communion was with earth and sky; and to whom cloud and
mountain were as the face of friends. Solitude had no pain for him; day no
unsteady pleasures, nor night any fears. The crow that flew high overhead
would caw in the upper skies as it cast an eye downwards, and saw him
creeping below. The goatsucker would birr in his face as it crossed his
path in the gloom; and the cuckoo in his season would give utterance to
his notes from the trees closest upon his habitation. He never molested
them, but seemed, as it were, a part of the wild nature around him. A tame
jackdaw, that hopped and chattered about his dwelling, was the only thing
whose voice he heard there, save only that of one human being, that
sometimes cried in complaint or pain from a deep part of the cavern behind
the front room of his hut, and that was the voice of James Woodruff.
</p>
<p>
As Jerry sat thus, sipping, smoking, or talking occasionally to his saucy
jackdaw, which had now perched itself on the point of one of his toes, and
was impudently saluting the leg that supported him with repeated dabs of
his heavy beak, the figure of a man, half seen amongst the thick heath
which covered the ground, appeared at a distance. Sometimes he turned one
way, sometimes another, as though winding out a devious path amongst the
broken irregularities of the ground; and anon he would stand still, and
look around, as though irresolute and doubtful which course to pursue.
Jerry watched a long time, but at length lost sight of him, partly owing
to the irregularities of the earth, and partly to the near approach of
night. As darkness fell upon the solitary world about him, Jerry retired
into his hut; and having lighted a small oil lamp, which shed about as
much light around as might have been comprised within the circumference of
a tolerably-sized round table, and left all the rest of the place in deep
spectral shadow, he sat down, with a huge pair of owl-eyed spectacles on,
to the perusal of the only book on the premises. Well nigh had he read
himself to sleep, when the, to him, extraordinary phenomenon of a civil
rap at the door was heard.
</p>
<p>
Were some learned gentleman meditating in his study, and at a time when he
believed himself perhaps to be the most alone, suddenly to receive a blow
beside the head from an unseen hand, he could not have started from his
seat with more instantaneous abruptness than did our old friend, Jerry, on
hearing that unusual summons. Throwing the door wide open, in order to
obtain a better view of whoever might be outside, he beheld the spare
figure of a man standing before him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well! what do you want here?&rdquo; gruffly demanded Jerry.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm lost in the forest,&rdquo; replied the stranger, &ldquo;though that, to be sure,
is my business, and not yours; but if you could either direct me elsewhere
not far off, or give me shelter till daylight&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; interrupted Jerry, &ldquo;I shall have nobody here.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And thereupon he was about to shut the door in Mr. Peter Veriquear's face&mdash;for
he it was&mdash;had not that gentleman made it his business to clap his
foot against it, and thus prevent Jerry's intention being carried into
effect. The latter instantly flew into a towering passion at this
interruption, and with a fearful oath threatened to ran his knife through
him if he did not give way immediately. Peter replied that he had no
intention in the world to affront him, or to force himself into the house
of any man who did not think it his duty to admit him; but at the same
time he appealed to him as a Christian to give him shelter for that one
night. Jerry swore that no man nor woman either should ever cross his
threshold&mdash;especially at that time of night&mdash;unless they strode
across his corpse. Saying which, he kicked Mr. Veriquear's shins as
savagely as might a vicious horse, and set him dancing an original
hornpipe of his own extemporaneous composition, while old Clink slammed to
the door, and bolted and barred it immediately.
</p>
<p>
It seemed then that the stratagem which Colin had formed, and of which Mr.
Veriquear was deputed to carry out the first part, had failed. This plan
had been,&mdash;that Peter should introduce himself to Jerry as a
travelling merchant who had lost himself, and was in want of a night's
shelter. That he should contrive to learn as much as possible of the place
while in it; and then, during the night, while Jerry was fast asleep,
quietly open the door to Colin and Roger Calvert, who had joined him in
the enterprise, and who should have been waiting not far off, in readiness
to take advantage of the opportunity thus afforded them at once to secure
old Jerry from doing any mischief, and then to effect the liberation of
James Woodruff without disturbance or unnecessary violence. But as Jerry's
brutality and caution had rendered this design ineffective even at its
commencement, Peter had no other course to pursue but to wait about in the
neighbourhood of the cottage&mdash;of the situation of which the parties
had pretty well assured themselves previously&mdash;until such time as his
confederates should come up, and other modes of operation could be
devised.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly he selected as comfortable a spot as the nature of the ground
would admit, within sight of the hut, where he crouched down amongst the
brushy heath, and waited, as he conceived it his business to do, until at
length he heard the bell of some distant village church-clock strike
twelve. In the stillness of the night it seemed as though that long drawn
out sound might have been heard across an infinite space of country; but
it was the more welcome to Peter's ears for being the signal which had
been agreed upon for the appearance of his associates, Colin and Roger
Calvert. In a short time he discerned indistinctly two figures cautiously
approaching over the broken ground, and apparently on the look-out for
their preconcerted signal from the cottage-door. Peter rose, and advanced
to meet them. It was with some difficulty at first sight of him that he
prevented their retreating, as thinking all was not right, and they were
discovered; but, having contrived to make himself known, they instantly
approached, and heard from him with disappointment the story of his
ineffectual attempt to get admitted to a nights lodging within Jerry's
cottage.
</p>
<p>
Under these circumstances, how to get into the cottage without disturbing
the savage inmate was now the question. They had come thus far on a
ticklish enterprise, and to remain in the neighbourhood long might excite
so much suspicion as would eventually render all their efforts nugatory.
It was not, therefore, advisable to delay, even as a matter of common
policy; while the daring spirit incident to young men of the age of Colin
and his friend induced them to make an attempt, which, under present
disadvantages, the more sober mind of Peter Veriquear considered rash in
the extreme.
</p>
<p>
The hut which Jerry inhabited being built up at, and partly within, the
mouth of a rock-hole, its roof reached scarcely so high as the ground
behind it, while a chimney of ample width, built principally of wood and
clay, rose some twelve inches above it at one end. Having taken as
accurate observation as the darkness of the night would permit of the
nature of the place, Colin now proposed that all three should descend the
chimney,&mdash;himself taking the lead,&mdash;with as much silence as
possible, in order to surprise and bind the old man, his grandfather,
while yet asleep and incapable of making any effectual resistance. Having
done this, a light was to be procured; and either by promises, threats, or
search made on their own parts, the place in which poor Woodruff was
imprisoned could then be discovered and broken open. And, although Mr.
Veriquear at first objected that it was a sweep's business, not his, to go
up and down chimneys, yet he eventually agreed to Colin's proposition, on
the condition that he himself should be the last to descend, in order that
the chimney might be swept and his clothes saved for him by those who went
before.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly our hero, as a preliminary caution, crept upon the moss-grown
roof, and placing his head over the top of the chimney, listened whether
anything below was stirring. The light and fire, according to Peter's
statement, had long ago been put out, but the air of the funnel over which
he leaned was yet hot, sooty, and sulphureous. It would be a stifling
undertaking to get down there; although the shortness of the distance from
the top to the fire-place promised but a brief continuance to their
struggle through such a black and uncomfortable region. As Colin
attentively listened at the mouth of this ventage, he distinctly heard old
Jerry snoring in his sleep sufficiently loud to have kept any bedfellow&mdash;had
he been blessed with one&mdash;awake; and at every inspiration growling
not unlike some jealous bull-dog when just aroused to the consciousness
that his master's property is about to be invaded. Still he listened, and
shortly heard more than that. Could it be? Was it possible? Yes, true
enough, he indistinctly heard the voice of
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;A soul that pray'd in agony,
From midnight chime to morning prime, Miserere Domine!&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
He heard in that awful midnight silence the whisperings of poor Woodruff
to his God, for freedom at some time to his spirit, and patience to endure
until that freedom came! That sound wrought upon his brain like madness;
it nerved him doubly for his enterprise, and urged him on to effect his
object this time, or perish in the attempt. Every other consideration, in
fact, vanished before the irrepressible determination he now felt, to set
poor Fanny's father free, or die.
</p>
<p>
Having arranged with his companions that they should follow him as
speedily as possible, he now prepared himself after the best manner he
could, and having taken off his boots to prevent noise, crept cautiously
into the chimney. After considerable trouble, and many pauses and
hesitations in order to assure himself that Jerry yet continued in his
heavy slumber, Colin landed with his feet one on each side the fire-place;
and thence he stealthily and silently crept down upon the floor. The whole
place seemed as dark as though he had been absolutely sightless; and every
movement of the limbs required to be made with such degree of slowness and
care as should render noise next to impossible even in case he should have
the ill-luck to meet with any obstacle in his endeavours to gain the open
portion of the apartment. Woodruff's voice was now still. Perhaps he had
sunk to the silence of despair, or of that last flickering of hope which
is closest akin to despair, with the heartache for his companion, as had
been his condition for years;&mdash;unthinking how that heart ached thus
for the last night at last, and that Providence had that moment sent a
deliverer, even into whose own ear had entered his last beseeching for
Heaven's mercy.
</p>
<p>
But though Colin heard nothing of Mr. Woodruff, the busy tongue of old
Jerry began to utter unintelligible jargon in his sleep; during which some
unconnected words about blood and everlasting damnation, muttered against
some one who had offended him, turned Colin cold with undefinable horror.
Had Jerry been awake, and uttered such knowingly, little in this sense
would it have affected him. But asleep,&mdash;the senseless body in its
time of rest, jabbering thus of horrors,&mdash;it seemed scarcely less
than as if some evil spirit had been heard to speak through the mouth of a
corpse, and had made known the fierce language of another and a darker
world.
</p>
<p>
As he stood thus, listening to the horrible tongue that thus muttered in
an unseen corner of the hut, Colin found that his friend, Roger Calvert,
had safely descended and reached the hearthstone. Gradually they groped
their way, directed by the nasal music which the old man unconsciously
played, close to his bedside, without in the least disturbing him. Their
object in this movement being to stand close ready to seize and hold him
down the moment everything else was prepared. Scarcely were they so
stationed ere a tremendous noise in the chimney, loud enough almost to
have wakened the Seven Sleepers, frightened at once them from their
propriety, and old Jerry from his pillow. In a clumsy attempt to make his
descent, Peter Veriquear had so far lost all foothold that nothing
remained to support him but his hands, by which he momentarily hung from
the chimney-top. This not being of sufficiently stable material to support
so important and weighty a personage, gave way all at once. Peter fell
with a formidable noise with his feet plump in the ashes of the
extinguished fire-place, which instantly flew up in a cloud that almost
choked him from below, while a very uncomfortable quantity of rubbish fell
upon his head from the funnel-top.
</p>
<p>
Simultaneously, as it were, with the disastrous fall of Mr. Peter
Veriquear was the up-springing of Jerry Clink. With the sudden and
desperate muscular energy of a giant, with which the circumstance of being
so awakened unconsciously supplied him, he leaped upright from his bed
several feet; and in all probability would have been the next instant on
his feet in the room, had it not fortunately happened that the suddenness
of his spring upwards had not allowed him time to call to recollection the
presence of a heavy beam, which projected out not far above him. Against
this he chanced to strike the top of his head with a degree of violence
that sent him back almost insensible before even his lips had power to
utter the least cry of complaint. This our adventurers instantly found by
the helpless manner in which he lay on the bed, and immediately they
proceeded to take advantage of the circumstance thus opportunely, though
so strangely, thrown in their way.
</p>
<p>
Peter Veriquear still stood upright within the bars of the grate, ready to
ascend again in case his disaster had rendered such a step advisable; but
as his feet had stirred up the ashes in the grate, Colin was glad to
observe a few live coals yet glimmering at the bottom. These he contrived
to blow into sufficient heat to light a piece of dry half-burnt stick that
lay on the hearth; and in the next moment the room in which they stood was
distinctly illuminated throughout. The first step was to light a candle
that stood on the table, and the next to see to the state and security of
old Jerry. Peter Veriquear now descended from his situation, considerably
shaken by his fall, though otherwise unhurt. The only complaint he made
being that it was the builder's business to have constructed the
chimney-top more solidly, and then it would never have been any concern of
his to have tumbled down it.
</p>
<p>
On proceeding to the bed Colin found old Jerry lying all of a heap, his
white hair covered with blood from a wound on the top, and himself
apparently senseless. There was no time to be lost. He therefore left his
friend Roger and Mr. Veriquear to assist the old man, at the same time
instructing them very carefully to secure him if he should attempt to
escape from them; while he himself went in search of the cavern, or
whatever else it might be, where Mr. Woodruff was confined. As the best
guide to this, he demanded in a loud voice, &ldquo;Mr. Woodruff!&mdash;where are
you?&mdash;where are you?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
There was no reply. Again he repeated those words, but in a state of
feeling which left him almost unconscious of all he said or did.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here&mdash;here I am!&rdquo; at length was answered in a melancholy tone, from
an inner place far backhand apparently beyond a door of very small
dimensions, securely fastened into the rock, and bound with heavy iron.
</p>
<p>
Colin flew to the spot whence the sound proceeded. The door was as fast as
the rock it was built in. He madly strove to burst it, but with as little
effect as the rain might beat against a precipice of adamant. Almost in a
frenzy of excitement he rushed back, and scarcely knowing what he did,
searched the cottage for the key. At last he found it under Jerry's
pillow.
</p>
<p>
Colin rapidly hastened again to the door,&mdash;he inserted the key,&mdash;he
turned it. A damp sweat stood upon his brow, and his eyeballs seemed
almost to blaze, but their sight was nearly gone. He seized the handle,
dashed the door open, and beheld James Woodruff standing with his hands
chained together before him.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are free!&rdquo; cried Colin, almost hysterically,&mdash;&ldquo;free!&mdash;free!&rdquo;
 He could but repeat that word; to him there was then no other in the
language&mdash;&ldquo;You are free!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Poor James looked at him doubtfully,&mdash;madly, I might say,&mdash;and
replied, &ldquo;Do not play with me, whoever you are. It is cruel to trifle with
sorrow like mine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;You are free!&rdquo; again cried Colin. &ldquo;Come forth!&mdash;you are free!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
James looked at him as though those deep black eyes, which yet had lost
none of their lustre, would pierce to the very centre of his soul, and
asked, &ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it true?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; exclaimed Colin, &ldquo;as God is good!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Poor Woodruff placed his hand upon his forehead, as though those words had
annihilated thought, and planted insanity where reason was before. When he
removed it again, his eyes were fixed on Colin, as though set there for
everlasting. He staggered towards him with desperate energy of spirit, but
with the feebleness of a child in body. He approached him,&mdash;stretched
out his arms,&mdash;strove to speak,&mdash;failed,&mdash;strove a second
time, and a second time he found no words. At last he <i>shrieked</i>,&mdash;literally
shrieked, as might a woman, and fell on his face in a swoon.
</p>
<p>
It would be unnecessary to tell in detail the immediate circumstances that
afterwards took place. These can be quite as well imagined as described.
Suffice it simply to state, that Mr. Woodruff was soon raised from the
ground, and placed on the bottom of Jerry Clink's bed; that a bottle of
the old man's spirit was soon discovered by Roger Calvert in a cupboard,
and brought forth, in order that a needful portion of it might be applied
in the restoration of the poor captive to consciousness.
</p>
<p>
This desirable purpose having been achieved, Mr. Woodruff sat up, and
looking wildly about him, again asked doubtfully if it really was true
that he was free? Our hero eagerly assured him of the fact, and desired
him not to trouble himself farther about it, as he was amongst none but
friends, who would take care that no possible harm of any kind should
again befal him. He reminded him that he himself was that same Colin Clink
who had once before concerted a plan for his escape; entreated him to be
calm and collected; and gave him the fullest assurances that all his
troubles were now at an end, and that in the course of a short time he
should be conveyed to a place where the infamous powers of his enemies
should never be able to touch him again. But poor James still seemed
incredulous,&mdash;lost in uncertainty, and scarcely decided whether to
believe his senses, or to conclude that they had forgotten their proper
office, and conspired with evil men to persuade him into the belief of a
state which had no existence in reality. Colin informed him that the
unprincipled villain Doctor Rowel, his brother-in-law, was now in prison,
and awaiting his trial on a charge of murder, so that nothing was to be
feared from that otherwise most formidable quarter: while in other
respects the most influential persons were now his friends, and would not
only secure the liberty he at present possessed, but also take steps to
recover everything of which he and his daughter had been so long
wrongfully dispossessed. At the name of his daughter James started,&mdash;for
the memory of her had not before, from over-excitement, awakened in his
mind. But when he heard her name,&mdash;only her name, and nothing more,&mdash;tears
gushed from his eyes, and he sobbed convulsively during some minutes.
</p>
<p>
Colin knew that this passion would give the mind relief, and therefore
abstained from farther discourse, and let his tears flow on.
</p>
<p>
Meantime, however, every necessary means were adopted to provide for an
immediate and successful evacuation of the premises. The night was
advancing, and every advantage ought to be taken of the cover afforded by
darkness. The chain which bound Mr. Woodruff's hands was soon knocked off,
and indignantly thrown by honest Roger through the window; while Jerry's
long coat&mdash;that identical garment which we have seen him previously
purchase in the Goswell-road&mdash;was forced on to the late prisoner's
back, in order to enable him the better to resist that open air to which
he was now so unaccustomed.
</p>
<p>
It must not be supposed that during all this time old Jerry himself had
been neglected. When all the necessary precautions to prevent his attempts
to resort to any violence on his recovery had been carefully adopted, they
turned their attention to his condition. Every means had been used in
order to bring him again to a state of sensibility, and at length their
efforts had the desired effect.
</p>
<p>
The old man opened his eyes, at first gradually, but at length turned them
in piercing scrutiny on the people about him. When he saw Mr. Peter
Veriquear, who held firmly one of his feet down upon the mattress,&mdash;the
self-same stranger he had that night turned away from his door,&mdash;when
he beheld his own grandson, Colin, standing at his head, and the man over
whom he was put in charge, James Woodruff himself, sitting free at the
foot of the bed,&mdash;then old Jerry made an effort to get up; but the
exertion was too much for him, and he fell back, loudly and deeply cursing
all around him, until he became again insensible.
</p>
<p>
It was not by any means in accordance with Colin's principles or feelings
to leave the old man in this state alone, whatever advantages it might
afford him for making a safe retreat from the place, and thus securing Mr.
Woodruff's safety against any pursuit on the part of Jerry himself, or of
such of the people at the house of Doctor Rowel's brother as he might
possibly arouse to join in such an expedition. He therefore begged of
Roger and Mr. Veriquear to use their utmost exertions in restoring him to
perfect consciousness before they took their departure, in order that no
chance of his dying beyond the reach of assistance might possibly happen.
Accordingly, after some trouble, he was a second time brought round; and
when seemingly in a state to be questioned, Colin told him what their
purpose there had been, and demanded to know whether, if they left him
entirely at liberty to shift in the best way he could for himself after
they were gone, he would agree neither to follow them himself, nor to give
any alarm to any other person?&mdash;at the same time observing, that
unless he would consent to this, he should find himself under the very
painful necessity of tying him down to his own bedstead, and so leaving
him to whatever fortune Providence might see fit to put in his way. On
hearing this proposal, Jerry fell to cursing and swearing in a manner
truly fearful, and declared that he would follow them wherever they went,
as long as that rascally carcass he in habited had strength to put one leg
before the other. Nay, he even carried his resentment beyond his mortal
powers, and declared that he would track their footsteps as a spirit,
after his body had dropped dead, as it might do, upon the road.
</p>
<p>
Finding all argument utterly useless, Colin at length determined to set
out, trusting to the old man's miserable bodily condition for security
against alarm or pursuit, without resorting to any coercive measures for
detaining him in his present locality.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, a short time found Mr. Woodruff and his three friends upon
the wide waste of the forest, tracking their way in the dark northwards;
while Jerry Clink, in a state of excitement bordering almost on delirium,
rolled himself out of bed directly after their departure, with a
determined resolution to make his way up to the house of Doctor Rowel's
brother, and give the alarm touching what had that night happened.

CHAPTER VI.
</h2>
<h3>
<i>A chase by night, and the death of Jerry Clink.</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HITHER are we bound?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Woodruff of Colin, as soon as they
had reached the open air.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;To Kiddal Hall,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;My father, Mr. Lupton, charged me, in case
our attempt succeeded, to convey you there for the present, where most
probably he will meet us either on, or shortly after, our arrival. I have
provided a vehicle at a village near the forest, which will be ready the
moment we reach it, and then all fear of pursuit will be at an end.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The night was still dark, but clear, transparent, and fresh. A healthy
breeze swept across the waste, and sighed through the branches of the
trees around.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How I thank God for this!&rdquo; exclaimed Woodruff, &ldquo;and you, friendly
strangers, whom I can never compensate; for the delight I feel in this
liberty is beyond all estimation. It seems incredible to me even now; and
the world looks a new place, as if I had risen into another life after a
grave. Yet how magnificent it is!&mdash;how beautiful it is! The very feel
of the earth under my feet, the live wind in my face, and those glorious
stars that I have so long and so often looked on, though without this rare
and goodly prospect below them!&mdash;O God! O God!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He stretched his hands to heaven, and sunk upon his knees, while the three
friends stood silently by unwilling to interrupt him while he poured out
his heart in thankfulness and prayer. Fearful, however, of lingering too
long, Colin used his influence to urge him onward, or he would have
remained in this mere ecstacy of adoration none can tell how long.
Accustomed to darkness, the night suited him; individual flowers and
leaves, which to his companions appeared as masses, he could see with
separate distinctness; he plucked them with the eager delight of a child;
as they strode forward he would linger occasionally to gather the wild
berries as though they had been delicious fruit.
</p>
<p>
This excitement, and the unaccustomed exertion of such walking, at length
overcame him, after they had traversed two or three miles of the forest,
and, notwithstanding all his endeavours, Mr. Woodruff became incapable of
proceeding farther without assistance. Under these circumstances, Mr.
Roger Calvert and Peter Veriquear volunteered to carry him, a task which
they performed admirably, while Colin sometimes marched before, selecting
the most level ground, or lingered behind in the endeavour to ascertain
whether old Jerry had contrived to give any alarm, and set a pursuing
party after them.
</p>
<p>
This precaution of his proved not to be altogether needless As he crouched
down amongst the heath, in the endeavour so far to bring the ground over
which they had passed into a horizontal line with the sky, so as to enable
him to detect whatever upright objects might present themselves upon it,
he fancied he beheld certain moving figures in the direction in which they
themselves had come. Hereupon Colin requested his friends to hurry
forwards as rapidly as possible, while he remained where he was still
farther to reconnoitre. His suspicion soon proved to be just. The figures
rapidly advanced, until he could distinctly discern five men, one of whom,
by his voice, Colin instantly recognised to be Jerry himself. He was
exclaiming passionately, and, as far as Colin could catch broken words,
was calling down imprecations on his own head, and devoting it with
frantic rage to perdition for having so completely disabled him from
following in pursuit with all the expedition which otherwise he could have
used.
</p>
<p>
All his doubts being now satisfied, Colin had nothing to do but press
forwards, and hurry his companions also onward. This, however, their
burden in great part prevented; and as Mr. Woodruff partly ascertained the
cause of so much haste, he became excited to an extreme, and begged of
them rather to let him be killed upon the spot in resisting, than ever
again see those horrible walls, or endure aught like what he had endured
before. Every effort was made to pacify him, and assure him that no power
should seize him again; but his new and long-lost liberty was now so dear
to him, that the very thought of a possibility of being a second time
deprived of it made him tremble like a terrified infant.
</p>
<p>
As the pursuing party rapidly gained upon them, and our friends found it
impossible to advance with equal celerity, Colin recommended that they
should turn aside amongst the brushwood, and endeavour to seek security by
hiding, until the other party should have passed, a proposition which was
at once adopted; and they soon found a convenient harbour beneath the
boughs of an elm, that bent down from a high bank at the foot of which lay
a pool of water collected from the rains. While silently standing there,
the parties approached, and the voice of old Jerry could distinctly be
heard, as he swore that he thought his skull was broken, and he should
never survive it; while his discourse in other respects seemed to bespeak
a somewhat disordered mind.
</p>
<p>
How the circumstance happened Colin never could distinctly ascertain; but
true it is, that scarcely were they silently congratulating themselves on
the success of their stratagem, when a loud cry from Jerry Clink,
accompanied by a wild rush upon them, announced the fearful fact of their
discovery. Mr. Woodruff had previously been seated against the bank, and
before him the three friends now stood, prepared and resolved to defend
him to the last. Within a few moments a tremendous scuffle and fight
ensued, during which Roger Calvert and Peter Veriquear conducted
themselves most gallantly, and severely beat three of the assailants
between them. Jerry grew half frantic, and yelled with rage, more like a
savage uttering his war-whoop than any being of civilised mould. During
the confusion, the old man unluckily chanced to receive from some
unrecognised hand, whether of friend or opponent was never known, another
blow upon the crown, which completed that work which the former had left
undone. He was seen to stand stock-still a moment, as though stunned; he
tried to utter a curse upon the arm of him who had struck the blow; but
exhausted nature refused the evil promptings of that savage spirit; his
tongue sunk for ever silenced, and old Jerry dropped suddenly upon his
back, dead. This event, combined with the lesson which Colin and his
friends had given to Jerry's associates, put a termination to the
engagement. The body of the old man was carried off by them, and Colin and
his friends were left to pursue their journey without farther molestation.
</p>
<p>
In due time the latter party arrived at the village of which Colin had
previously made mention, where the vehicle he had provided was immediately
put in requisition, and the whole were driven off to the Hall of Kiddal,
where they arrived safely in the afternoon of the following day.
</p>
<p>
As for old Jerry, a coroner's inquest was subsequently held over his body,
when the facts of having met his death in the manner above described being
clearly established, the usual verdict was returned. His corpse was
committed to the ground, and after that time the matter gradually subsided
until it became utterly forgotten.

<h2>
CHAPTER VII.
</h2>
<p>
<i>Contains matter not to be found anywhere else in this or any other
history.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>R. Lupton was already at the Hall, and prepared to receive our little
party when they arrived. There was also awaiting Colin a letter from Jane
Calvert, the contents of which went far to destroy that pleasure which
else he could not have failed to experience from his present change of
fortune, and the triumphant success of the last-recorded enterprise. But
before this unpleasant piece of intelligence be farther commented on, it
is necessary to record certain other interesting matters, which eventually
produced a material influence, touching one or two of the leading
personages of this history.
</p>
<p>
The story of Mr. Woodruff's liberation, and of his arrival at Kiddal Hall,
accompanied by his deliverers, soon became known to the inhabitants of the
district; and as the fact of Doctor Rowel's imprisonment, with all the
main circumstances leading to and connected with it, had previously
created no little sensation amongst them, the presence of James Woodruff
excited universal attention. Numbers of idlers might have been seen
lounging about the village of Bramleigh, and in the immediate
neighbourhood of the Hall, anxious to pick up the smallest scrap of news
respecting the strangers from any of the servants, and deeply desirous of
catching even the most remote glimpse of any of the personages connected
with those proceedings which, in one shape or another, occupied so much of
their attention.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Colin caused a special and cautious messenger to be despatched
to Fanny Woodruff, for the purpose of informing her, in a manner the least
likely to over-excite her feelings, of the arrival of her father at the
Squire's mansion, and to appoint a particular hour on the ensuing day,
when her meeting with him should take place, it being deemed most
advisable on account of both parties to allow some portion of time to
elapse before that meeting was permitted. Particular apartments were, in
the mean time, appropriated to Mr. Woodruff, as being better adapted to
his present state both of body and mind. To recapitulate at length the
circumstances attendant on the meeting between poor James Woodruff and his
daughter forms no part of my design. It is enough to state, that the
feelings of each were wrought upon by that interview to the highest
extreme; that hours seemed to them but as minutes; and that night scarcely
separated them even temporarily without the bitterest tears.
</p>
<p>
Some time afterwards, when the condition of all parties would allow of it
without pain or danger, an entertainment upon a large scale was given at
the Hall, at which every one of the individuals most interested were
present, besides a considerable number of the neighbouring gentry, their
wives and families, whose sympathies had been aroused by that bitter story
of persecution and criminality, of which Mr. Woodruff had been made the
victim; and while all lamented the past sorrows of that worthy man, they
rejoiced with double feeling at the conclusion which was now put to his
sufferings, and extolled in the highest terms the very humblest individual
whose instrumentality had been required in the singular adventure that
terminated in his release.
</p>
<p>
On this occasion it was that Mr. Roger Calvert, the blunt and honest
brother of Jane, first became acquainted with Fanny Woodruff. Fanny, as
has been previously observed, was by no means deficient in personal
attractions, which now were rather heightened in interest than
depreciated, by the more delicate character her features had assumed since
the period of her first meeting with her father. Grief and anxiety had, if
I may so speak, spiritualised her looks, and attached a degree of interest
to her general appearance, which it did not possess before; while the
devotedness and love with which she watched her father, the eagerness to
anticipate his slightest wants, and the patient unwearying watch she kept
over him, while yet the yoke of the world into which he had come back sat
newly and awkwardly upon him,&mdash;all conspired to stamp both her person
and character with those amiable qualities which recommend themselves to
the notice, and not unfrequently to the love of the truly sensible and
discerning.
</p>
<p>
While Mr. Roger Calvert yet tarried at the Hall, he had frequent
opportunities of becoming more intimately conversant with both herself and
her parent. So favourably did these unpremeditated interviews affect the
young man, that it soon became evident that Fanny strongly attracted his
attention. And though at the outset she exhibited a degree of reluctance
to be wooed, bordering on absolute indifference, and which offered small
hope that ever she would consent to be won,&mdash;a state of feeling which
the presence of Colin contributed not a little to produce,&mdash;yet at
length her heart relented somewhat; and she found, besides, in the
character and disposition of Roger perhaps a better substitute for Colin
than the chance of a thousand might give her: a good reason this to her
mind for listening with more favour to his suit than she would or could
have done to that of another person who might have occupied the same
position. She heard Colin, moreover, always express himself in such high
terms of his friend, as could not fail to have considerable influence in
predisposing her in his favour. Then, too, there was that strongest tie of
all, the demands of gratitude to her lover for the part he had taken in
restoring to liberty and his friends a parent whom else she had looked
upon as for ever lost to both. This attachment caused Mr. Calvert to
prolong his stay considerably beyond his original intention; combined as
it was with the pressing solicitations of Mr. Lupton, who would not think
of permitting so early a departure to the son of a friend who had been one
of his dearest acquaintances even in boyhood.
</p>
<p>
Fanny, it is perhaps almost unnecessary to relate, had left Lawyer
Sylvester's house almost immediately after the happy arrival of her father
at Kiddal. The leisure thus afforded her was taken ample advantage of by
Roger, whose attentions to his daughter were marked by Mr. Woodruff with
deep interest and pleasure: that gentleman feeling that no reward in his
power to bestow could ever so much as approach that idea of return which
he entertained for the boundless service that had been rendered him;
though the greatest in his power to give, had he even possessed worlds,
would yet in his estimation have been the hand of so dear a child, with
such a portion on her marriage as would place her in ease for life out of
that recovered property which soon he should again obtain.
</p>
<p>
Thus sanctioned at once by her sense of gratefulness, by the approving
smiles of her poor restored father, and the lavish praise bestowed upon
the individual who sought her hand by Colin, it is no matter of wonder
that her estimation of Roger daily grew more favourable, until at length
she fairly yielded to his solicitations, and received him as that
certainly accepted lover who was one day to make her his bride.
</p>
<p>
With respect to Colin's mother, Mrs. Clink, he seized the earliest
opportunity afforded by his return into that part of the country to wait
upon her with the assurance of his present happiness from the kindness and
liberality of one whom now he knew to be his father, as well as to convey
to her from that gentleman&mdash;though without explanation&mdash;a
present of two hundred pounds. Mrs. Clink expressed herself in terms of
deep satisfaction at the fortunes which now appeared to be in waiting for
her son; but at the same time informed him that she could never enjoy a
mother's highest delight and be a daily witness of her child's prosperity
and happiness, as it would be more congenial to her own feelings, to carry
into execution a design she had some time since formed of retiring to a
distant part of the country, where, unknown, and out of sight of all those
who, under the circumstances now brought about, might be to her, as she to
them, a cause of painful reflection, she could quietly pass the remaining
portion of her life in humble endeavours to atone for the one great error
of her existence, and hide the troubles it had entailed upon her for ever
from the world.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Circumstances,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;too plain to be named, or more particularly
alluded to, urge me to adopt this course. Though you are my son, I should
find it impossible under these altered prospects to act in everything as a
mother's heart would dictate. Though I am your mother, you too would find
it still more impossible at all times to act as your filial feelings would
prompt you to do. To live so closely together, with these bars between our
intercourse, which nothing but the death of&mdash;one who I hope will yet,
<i>for your sake</i>, live long&mdash;could not be consistent with either
your disposition or mine. It is better, then, that I should quietly retire
to some far-off obscurity in which to pass the remainder of my days, and
be content to hear occasionally of your happiness, while with humble and
contrite feelings of heart, I endeavour to fit myself for that fearful and
tremendous appearance before an immortal Judge, which, sooner or later&mdash;with
this weight of sin upon my soul&mdash;I shall be called upon to make.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Colin wept bitterly, while his mother's hands, as she spoke thus, pressed
feelingly his own. He saw too much good sense in her remarks to attempt to
controvert them, although he strove as much as possible to soften the
asperity of those self-accusations with which they were intermingled. He
promised her, however, that, so far as his resources would allow, she
should be made as comfortable and happy as in this world we can hope to
be; and that he would on all occasions omit nothing calculated in any
degree to afford her comfort if not entire happiness.
</p>
<p>
In accordance with this decision, Mrs. Clink scrupulously carried out the
plan she had proposed. She retired with a competency to a small village in
Derbyshire, where she dwelt in peaceful seclusion many years afterwards;
receiving from time to time those affectionate communications from her son
which formed in great part at once her company and her consolation.

CHAPTER IX.
</h2>
<p>
<i>Tells of trouble in love, and trouble after marriage. Miss Jenny is
persuaded by Mrs. Lupton to abandon her affection for Colin.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ET us now resume the thread of our story, and begin with that
communication from Miss Calvert to Colin, previously adverted to as the
cause of much pain to him. It ran as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Since Mr. Clink quitted our now forsaken-looking house at &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
my mother has had much to say to me,&mdash;oh, too much that it is
impossible to tell again, and that I am most unhappy in ever having heard.
I know not why it is I should have been destined to so much trouble, for I
never wilfully harmed one human creature even by a word, nor ever injured
the meanest thing that had a life to enjoy, and which the Creator had made
for its own enjoyment. Perhaps it is the will of Heaven that this grief
should come upon me to try what virtue of resignation to its will I may
possess. And if so, then indeed have I been sorely tried, most acutely
probed and searched. During your absence, it seems to have become more
fixedly my mother's intention that I shall never be happy. She has
expressed her urgent desire that I would beg of you to forget me, and now
you are away, make no endeavour ever to see me even once again. I never
slept a wink, but cried, and prayed for you, my dearest Colin, all night
upon my pillow. I am very ill now, and can scarcely do anything but weep.
However, I will make my heart as strong as I can, for I foresee it has a
terrible task to undergo. Were I of that religion which permits such
things, I would now go into a convent, where no one should ever know my
thoughts but Heaven; where I could ask on my knees, day and night, for
forgiveness for those thoughts that I have not power to prevent; and where
no eye that now knows me, should ever again see how pitiable and
heart-broken a creature is even so soon made of the once happy, though now
too wretched, but still devotedly affectionate&mdash;
</p>
<h3>
&ldquo;J. C.&rdquo;
 </h3>
<p>
I cannot better describe the effect produced upon Colin's mind by the
perusal of this epistle, than by stating that within ten minutes
afterwards, he formed a dozen different and very desperate determinations
to rescue his mistress from her trouble, each one of which respectively
was abandoned again almost as soon as formed. He would hurry back to
London,&mdash;remonstrate with Mr. and Mrs. Calvert. No, on second
thoughts, he would not do that. He would write to Jane herself, and
beseech her to calm her mind and wait with patience in the hope that
happiness was still in store for them. And yet, what would be the utility
of that? Would it not be preferable to act with spirit, and at once give
up all thoughts of maintaining his courtship any longer?&mdash;or more
advisable, or desirable, or prudent, or proper, to do&mdash;what? In fact
he felt absolutely puzzled, and could not tell. In this dilemma he laid
Miss Calvert's letter before her brother Roger, who at once flatly
declared that if it were his case, if he happened unluckily to be
similarly circumstanced with respect to Fanny Woodruff, as was Colin with
regard to his sister Jane, he would make up his mind to run away with her
at once, get married, and leave the old folks to reconcile themselves to
the event in the best manner they might.
</p>
<p>
This suggestion wonderfully coincided with Colin's present state, both of
feeling and thinking; he felt quite astonished that he had not hit upon
the same expedient himself; but determined to adopt it without farther
loss of time. And in all probability he would have done so within the
shortest given space from that day, more especially as his friend Roger
volunteered to write to Jane advising her to consent to that mode of
settling matters,&mdash;had not an event occurred which for the present
caused him to set his design entirely aside. This was no other than the
arrival at the Hall of that long absent lady, of whom lately we have heard
so little mention, the amiable Mrs. Lupton.
</p>
<p>
Colin happened to be wandering solitarily in the gardens, musing sadly
over the subject of his love, when the carriage drove up that brought the
Squire's lady once more back to that home which she loved best, but which
it had not been her fate in life to enjoy. As the young man watched, he
observed a female anxiously gazing through one of the windows, and
endeavouring to obtain a first glimpse of those old walls which to her
spoke so eloquently, so mournfully of past times, of years of happiness
once, and only once, anticipated when she first entered them a bride; but
of years of unhappiness realized, of bright visions faded; and sad
remindings that the silver chain of a woman's dearest hopes had been
snapped asunder, ay, even at the very moment when most the busy mind and
hopeful heart had with bootless industry been employed in linking it
together!
</p>
<p>
When the carriage stopped, he saw that a lady descended from it attended
by two females, whose assistance appeared needful to enable her to alight
with safety, and to walk into the house. As she stood upon the ground, our
hero was struck with the elegance of her figure; although her countenance
plainly denoted in its worn and anxious beauty that she was one of those
whom trouble unrevealed has destined to &ldquo;grow old in youth, and die ere
middle age.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
As she passed up the pathway, supported by the arms of her attendants, she
stopped to pluck the first rose that came to hand.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said she, gazing on it with an expression of countenance which
might most properly be termed affectionate, &ldquo;I love this flower&mdash;though
it seems a fading one&mdash;better for the ground it grew on, the air it
lived in, and the eyes&mdash;it may be&mdash;that have looked upon it;&mdash;I
say the eyes that may have looked upon it, for he is my husband still, and
this is my natural home;&mdash;I love it better, I tell you, than if it
were grown in Paradise, and had been tended by an angel.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The sun shone brilliantly; and as her face was turned upwards, Colin saw
distinctly that her bright blue eyes were not tearless, nor the heart
within that bosom at such peace as the lovely creature it gave life to
seemed to merit.
</p>
<p>
Already had the Squire apprised him of the expected arrival of his wife,
and therefore Colin felt no doubt that in the individual before him he now
saw Mrs. Lupton. Nor in this belief was he mistaken. As she entered the
hall she regarded everything&mdash;the minute equally with the great&mdash;with
that degree of interest which any individual might be supposed to feel,
who after many years should turn over anew the leaves of some old record
of their by-gone life, wherein was shown again the past as now existing;
save that it now looked upon no future of possible joy or rest, unless in
that world which, happily, is beyond man's reach to darken or make sad.
</p>
<p>
As early after Mrs. Lupton's arrival as was consistent with a proper
consideration of her state of health, and the quietude necessary after the
fatigue of the journey she had undergone, Mr. Lupton desired and obtained
an interview with her alone, which lasted during a space of four or five
hours. In the course of that time communications of deep interest to both
parties must have been made, as it was observed that more than once the
services of Mrs. Lupton's attendants were required in order to save her
from fainting, while the eyes of her husband evidently betrayed that even
on his part their conversation had not been conducted without tears.
</p>
<p>
That same evening Mr. Lupton conducted Colin into the apartment where his
lady was sitting, and presented him with the remark, &ldquo;This, madam, is the
young man of whom I have before spoken.&rdquo; A gentle inclination seemed to
mark that she perfectly understood what was said and done, although the
terms in which her reply was couched evidently betrayed that the long
years which had elapsed since last we saw her affecting interview with
Miss Mary Shirley in that same old hall, had produced no permanent
restoration of the then partly overthrown and too deeply troubled mind.
She looked in Colin's face fixedly, and apparently without emotion; and
although it is, perhaps, needless to add, she had never seen him before,
she remarked&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I have the pleasure of knowing him well. I remember that face as
well&mdash;nay better&mdash;better than any other in the world; though it
is more than twenty years since I saw it before.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
It has already been remarked that Colin bore a more than common
resemblance to the Squire.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And when,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;when shall I see it again?&mdash;Never more! I
shall never see it again. It went from me soon after I was wed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now pray be calm,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Lupton, in a persuasive and kind tone,
when he found that the agitation and excitement resulting from what had so
recently passed between them had produced a temporary recurrence of her
disorder. &ldquo;Be calm, madam, and we will talk these matters over at some
future time.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And this favour,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Lupton, &ldquo;I shall beg of you
particularly: I would have no one put me out of this house any more till
the end; for though there are so many wicked people about that want to
lead me astray, I will endure everything patiently, and soon get me out of
the way where no man's snares shall ravel me again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Under the unhappy and painful circumstance of this temporary alienation of
mind having thus again occurred, Mr. Lupton and Colin very properly
retired from the room, leaving the unfortunate lady in the hands of her
female attendants, one amongst whom was her old companion Miss Shirley.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Lupton, as the last-named individual approached
her, &ldquo;I have seen Walter Lupton again, just as when he used to see me at
my father's&mdash;but I am resolved I will not marry him. Men do so
flatter us! And in a week after we find ourselves more lonely than before
we knew anybody. This beauty is all our ruin. The pretty apple soon goes,
Mary, but the crab hangs till Christmas.
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Oh, each a ribbon of white shall have,
And a dead flower be carried before her!
</pre>
<p>
Then there's that Jenny Calvert too. I have loved that girl ever since she
was born: she is a dear good creature, Mary,&mdash;a pretty sweet thing;
but she cries just like one of the wicked, so there seems the same dish
for all of us. Now, I tell her, never to marry one of Walter Lupton's
friends, else we may be all alike; and I would not have her like me, not
for a silver penny six times counted!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I understand,&rdquo; replied Miss Shirley, &ldquo;that he is a very worthy young
man, and that Jane is deeply in love with him. She cries for what she has
not&mdash;not over what she has.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then let her have him by all means,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Lupton; &ldquo;for if the
girl love so much, she must be unhappy to her life's end without him; and
as there is a chance that all men may not be alike, and all women not so
unfortunate as I&mdash;most unfortunate&mdash;I would advise her to try
that chance. I would have her happy, as she most deserves.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Not to prolong the description of this and similar painful scenes, be it
sufficient to state that, after the lapse of a few days, when Colin was
again introduced to her, Mrs. Lupton had fully recovered her
self-possession, and perfectly comprehended certain arrangements which Mr.
Lupton had mentioned to her touching that young man whom he intended to
make his heir, and whose parentage was no longer to her a mystery. In
these arrangements she quietly acquiesced, not because she felt any
interest in them, or would allow herself in any manner to acknowledge that
she could in the least be identified with the young man whom Mr. Lupton
had now introduced to the house; but simply because her husband had
proposed and desired them. At the same time, while his every wish was
hers, personally she felt that degree of indifference, respecting any
arrangements he might make, not unusual with individuals who have been
long hopeless of all happiness, so far as the present life is concerned,
and who, consequently, contemplate the world to come as their only place
of refuge and of rest, while the present, with all its pleasures, its
anxieties, and its affairs, proportionably sinks in their estimation, as
scarcely worthy even of a moment's serious consideration.
</p>
<p>
Whether this feeling was unconsciously accelerated by the closeness of an
event which shortly after happened, and which&mdash;happily, perhaps, it
may be deemed&mdash;put an end to all Mrs. Lupton's earthly sorrows, I
will not pretend to divine; yet it has occasionally been asserted that the
nearness of death (although at the time unknown) will often produce those
exhibitions of sentiment and feeling, as regards the things of this world,
which are never so fully made under any other circumstances. It is not for
the writer of this history to speculate on such a subject; with facts
alone has he to do: and, therefore, the reader must here be informed that,
now Mrs. Lupton's proper faculties had returned, she strenuously opposed&mdash;notwithstanding
what we have previously recorded as having escaped from her lips&mdash;the
marriage of her young friend, Miss Calvert, with Colin. On that one
question only did she evince the least interest in anything connected with
him; but no sooner was she made aware that he was the object of that
affection which had caused Miss Calvert so much trouble, than she retired
to her room, and, without delay, addressed to her the following
communication, dated from the Hall:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Believe me, my dearest Jenny, when I express to you the pain I feel in
writing to you on such an occasion as the present, and in obtruding my
sentiments upon you respecting a subject of such deep interest to your own
heart, that upon the next step you take in it may probably depend your
happiness or misery during the whole of your after-life. But as I am not
happy, and have felt too grievously the impossibility of being made so any
more in this world, it will not be difficult for you to credit my motives
in wishing you to think, only <i>think</i>, how, by an ill-considered
proceeding, you may do that in one moment which a whole after-life of pain
can never remedy, and from which nothing but the grave can afford you a
refuge. The young gentleman who has been introduced to you is not exactly
what he has been represented&mdash;Mr. Lupton's friend. He is something
more. Would that he were <i>my</i> son, for your dear sake! Then, my
dearest girl, should I wish him no higher happiness than the possession of
so good and true a creature, nor you any better love and care than I
should delight in exercising towards you. It is unfit that I should tell
you more than this; though possibly your own good sense may enable you to
supply the deficiency. If you can give up this disastrous affection, let
me implore you to do so. I fear it cannot end in any happiness. Why I say
so, I scarcely know; but I feel that fear most deeply. Perhaps my own
wretchedness makes me doubt whether there be such a state as happiness
really to be met with, in any shape, in the world. But whatever the cause,
let me again and again, as you regard the last words of a true friend,
beseech you never to consent to such a match as would make you mistress of
this unhappy and mournful house. I know everything, and warn you
advisedly.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ever and for ever
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your affectionate
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Elizabeth Lupton.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
By a singular coincidence, the same post which placed the above in Miss
Calvert's hands, also conveyed to her two others:&mdash;one from Colin,
and the other from her brother Roger. Colin's was opened the first.&mdash;It
contained all those passionate appeals and protestations which, from a
person so circumstanced, might naturally have been expected. Judging from
this epistle, Colin was in a state of desperation, scarcely to be
sufficiently described; although he concluded by expressing his
determination never to relinquish his suit, though all the powers of earth
conspired to oppose him, or even Jane herself should be induced by her
supposed friends to resist his addresses. But while he possessed the
consciousness of her eternal affection, it was utterly impossible for him
by any means to do otherwise than persist through all trials until fortune
should be compelled at length to crown his hopes.
</p>
<p>
This spirited production at first inspired poor half-heart-broken Jane
with momentary hope; the more especially so as she found, too, on opening
her brother Roger's letter, that he also advised her by no means to
sacrifice her own happiness&mdash;if her happiness really did depend upon
the event of this attachment&mdash;merely out of compliance, however
otherwise desirable, with the wishes of those who could take no share from
off her bosom of the load which their own agency had once placed there.
Roger reminded her, that while others rejoiced, she might have to suffer;
and that for his own part he never wished to see the day when his sister
might possibly pine away her solitary hours in grief, which it was likely
would hurry her to the grave, instead of being the happy wife of a young
man whom she loved, and who, as far as he could observe, very well merited
her attachment. At the same time, he declared in the most positive terms,
that the real objection urged by her parents and friends against Colin,
was not, in his opinion, a valid one. That it did not in the remotest
degree touch the character or qualifications of the youth himself, and
ought never to have been by any means so pertinaciously insisted on.
</p>
<p>
These remarks in some degree counteracted the bitterness of those which
had made her weep over her friend Mrs. Lupton's letter, although they
served in some degree to assist her in drawing that correct conclusion as
to the true cause of objection, which now was rendered sufficiently
evident to her mind. Yes, now she conjectured it:&mdash;her lover was not
Mrs. Lup-ton's son, but he was more to Mr. Lupton than a friend. Besides,
these matters had not been altogether unknown to her family during some
years past; and, therefore, a certainty almost seemed to exist that her
father and mother saw in the parentage of Colin the bar to their future
union.
</p>
<p>
How long Jane grieved over this discovery and these letters, I need not
say, but grieve she did, until some that had known her slightly knew her
not again; and those who had known her best became most deeply certain,
that if this was suffered to continue, a light heart was for ever
exchanged for a sad one, and the creature whose very presence had diffused
happiness, was converted into one of those melancholy beings over whose
mind an everlasting cloud seems to have settled; whose looks
instantaneously demand our pity, we scarce know why, and whose very bodily
existence appears to become spectral and unearthly, while yet they sit at
our table, or muse statue-like with melancholy by our hearth. Then it was
that the obstinate began to soften, the strict to relax, the determined to
think that continued opposition to the ways of the heart is too cruel to
be always maintained. Everybody loved poor Jane, and everybody grieved to
see her grief. So at length they proceeded from the direct exertion of
counter influences upon her, to the tacitly understood holding out of
hope, and the sometimes expressed possibility that matters might yet be
ultimately arranged to her satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, as the Squire's object in introducing his son to Mrs. Lupton
had been fulfilled, Colin took the earliest opportunity, in company with
Roger Calvert, to return to London, and throw himself with passionate
sorrow before his mistress. But before we follow him thither, and record
his fortunes, the reader will, perhaps, be pleased to hear something
respecting certain other of the characters who have figured in this book,
to whose interest, be it hoped, he does not feel altogether indifferent.

CHAPTER X.
</h2>
<p>
<i>A corpse missing. The trial. The verdict. The effect of it. A fearful
night scene at Nabbfield.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N order that the charge brought against Doctor Rowel, of having been
guilty of the murder of Lawyer Skinwell, might if possible be clearly
substantiated, Mr. Lupton had not omitted any means at all likely to
conduce towards that end; not the least important of which was the
disinterment of the deceased's coffin from its grave, in the churchyard of
Bramleigh, where it had been laid. This curious operation was undertaken
with as much quietness as such an unusual piece of business can reasonably
be supposed to have been performed; and a careful examination would,
doubtless, have taken place in the porch of the church, had it not been
soon discovered, to everybody's amazement, on opening the grave, that
somebody had been there before, and the corpse was gone. This fact was no
sooner ascertained than speculations innumerable, and of every variety,
started into existence with the suddenness of a batch of summer flies; and
strange stories were published, which had never so much as been dreamed of
before, by the very parties who now gave instant birth to them, of dim
lights having been seen, or supposed to have been seen, in the churchyard
after dark; of something like the sound of a spade having been once heard
there in the dead of night,&mdash;though, when heard, or what favoured
mortal had heard it, could not precisely be made out:&mdash;as well as of
suspicious looking strangers having, at one time, been observed staring
over the yard wall, as though marking in the mind's eye some spot which
was destined to become the scene of future dark and mysterious operations.
</p>
<p>
All these things however ended, as such things usually do, exactly where
they began. The vulgar, that is, nine hundred and ninety-nine at least,
out of every thousand, swallowed them with &ldquo;intense interest;&rdquo; while the
place itself, in which Mr. Skinwell's remains had once been deposited, and
from which they had also been thus unaccountably abstracted, became as a
standing wonder throughout the parish, and was daily visited and marvelled
at by bewildered and curious bipeds of both sexes. Certain parties who had
had the misfortune to fall under Mr. Skinwell's hands during his lifetime,
went so far as to insinuate that a lawyer's corpse was a very tempting bit
to the old gentleman himself, and a likely thing&mdash;nothing more so&mdash;to
have been carried off by him; but this insinuation was commonly thought at
once so palpably libellous, that though many heard, few took the trouble
to repeat it. Hence, like many other productions of a different
description, but presumed by their authors to be equally able, it died a
natural death very shortly after it was born. The mystery, however,
attending this circumstance was certainly never positively cleared up;
although on the examination of Doctor Rowel's establishment at Nabbfield,
some time afterwards, a rather curious circumstance occurred, which gave
strong ground for suspicion, that as that gentleman had been considerably
cut up by the lawyer when alive, he had seized his opportunity to return
the compliment, and cut him up, in another fashion, after his departure.
But this incident will better appear in another place.
</p>
<p>
Every other description of evidence which Mr. Lupton could possibly
procure was obtained and arranged for the Doctor's anticipated trial;
although the failure of that which might have been added by the abovenamed
investigation, could it have taken place, was regretted by all parties
desirous of bringing the supposed culprit to justice, as unfortunate in
the extreme.
</p>
<p>
While the Doctor soliloquized in a cell of the castle at York, whither he
had been removed between the time of which we are now speaking and that at
which we last parted with him, information was conveyed to him by his
brother, of the rescue of James Woodruff, by Colin and his party, and the
subsequent event of old Jerry Clink's death. His brother-in-law being thus
free, Doctor Rowel gave up everything as lost; and during some time after
the receipt of the news, he remained sunk in a state of hopelessness and
stupor as deserved as it was deplorable. Regarding himself as now
abandoned altogether by that fortune which during so many years had
permitted his infamous practices and designs, he so far lost all spirit as
to sink into one of the most abject creatures that ever breathed the
breath of life. Painfully fearful of the end which seemed to be awaiting
him, his sole anxiety was to contrive means for averting the threatened
fate, and of prolonging that life which few, save himself, valued at more
than a rope's end. Under these circumstances, and dreading the course
which Mr. Woodruff himself might see fitting to adopt, the doctor caused a
formal communication to be made to that injured individual, through the
agency of Mr. Lupton, in which he bound himself not only to restore the
estate of Charnwood, which had been so long withheld from him, but also to
make every restitution in his power to grant, for the injuries he had
sustained; injuries indeed for which in reality no compensation could
atone, but which he yet trusted might possibly be regarded with some
feeling of forgiveness and mercy, when his awful situation in other
respects came to be considered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Unworthy,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Woodruff, when this statement was made to him,&mdash;&ldquo;undeserving
and unworthy as that man is, whom I cannot ever again name as a relation,
or scarcely consider even in the common light of an ordinary human being,&mdash;and
hideous even to remember as are the tortures of mind and body I have
undergone through conduct on his part which might well be considered as
little less than infernal,&mdash;yet I do not feel disposed to gratify any
feeling of revenge, by demanding the infliction of that extreme punishment
which doubtless the laws would allow. I have suffered, but those
sufferings are past; they cannot be alleviated in the least by the
sufferings of another. If he even died upon a scaffold, what consolation
would that bring to me? To know that he pined in prison as I have done,
and wore away interminable days, nights, and years, in exquisite pain,&mdash;would
not give me any satisfaction. I know too well what that sorrow is, ever to
wish it endured by even the most worthless and criminal wretch alive. No;
all I wish that man to do is, to be left to the reflection that all his
stratagems have, at length, failed; that the evil labours of so many years
have produced him only a harvest of wretchedness. I would leave his own
past actions to be the rack on which&mdash;if he have any spark of
humanity left within him&mdash;his spirit must eventually be broken. For
the rest,&mdash;the great and fearful trial of the future,&mdash;that lies
between Heaven and him;&mdash;and a frightful contemplation it must
prove!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Although every person who heard these sentiments from Mr. Woodruff's
mouth, could not but feel deeply the charity and worthiness of that good
and injured man, yet the general sentiment appeared to be that in leaning
towards the guilty Doctor, and overlooking the irreparable injuries he had
himself sustained, he forgot justice in his anxiety for mercy, and allowed
that degree of criminality to escape to which the common opinion of
mankind at large would apportion punishment of considerable severity.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Mr. Woodruff remained uninfluenced by those and many similar
remarks; and notwithstanding even the persuasions and advice of Mr. Lupton
himself, persisted in his determination to abide by the opinions he had
already expressed, and leave his cruel brother-in-law without other
punishment than that which might possibly be awarded to him on his
forthcoming trial; or such as his own conscience, and now everlastingly
blighted prospects, would in all probability render inevitable.
</p>
<p>
Nor, in pursuing this charitable and moderate line of conduct was Mr.
Woodruff, as the event proved, at all mistaken; since a calamity more
fearful in its nature than any infliction of the criminal laws could
possibly have been&mdash;more terrible to contemplate than even an
ignominious death itself, subsequently befel the Doctor, and rendered him
to the last hour of his life an object at once of pity, detestation, and
fear. It seemed, indeed, that in this terrible visitation, Providence had
specially intended to exhibit such an instance of that retributive justice
which crime, though it escape the laws of man, not unfrequently entails
upon itself from the violated laws of nature, as should not only punish
the guilty individual himself, but stand as a solemn and striking warning
to all who might become acquainted with his story, that though sin and
evil may seem to bask securely in the sunshine for awhile, their time of
darkness and pain must come, as surely as midnight followeth the noon.
</p>
<p>
While the period fixed for his trial was drawing on, the constabulary of
the district made themselves uncommonly active in ferreting out every
scrap of evidence, as well as much that amounted to no evidence at all, in
the hope of fixing the guilt beyond all doubt upon the shoulders of a man
to whom everybody secretly believed it to belong, although many expressed
their fears that the fact could never be sufficiently established to
warrant a jury in pronouncing the doctor's doom.
</p>
<p>
The whole circumstances preceding and attendant on the case were of such
an unusual nature, and had now become in their leading particulars so well
known, that when the day of trial at length actually arrived, the most
extraordinary interest was evinced by the public to get admitted into the
court, or obtain even the most passing glimpse of the prisoner. Many
persons came from distant parts of the country in order to be present
during this extraordinary investigation; and the yards and precincts of
the castle were crowded during the whole time it lasted by a multitude of
anxious and patient people, whose curiosity kept them in an inexhaustible
state of discussional fermentation from daylight till many hours after
dark on each day of the trial. At the same time the village of Bramleigh
exhibited such a scene of bustle and stir as had no parallel &ldquo;within the
memory,&rdquo; as the newspapers stated, &ldquo;of the oldest inhabitant of the
place.&rdquo; The village pot-house was literally besieged; the price of ale was
temporarily raised, or, what amounts to exactly the same thing, the
quality of it was materially lowered, while it was sold for the same
money; almost every flitch of bacon in the parish seemed placed in
imminent jeopardy of being sacrificed; the butcher declared he never did
so much business in his life before; and happy were all those fortunate
cottagers whose hens behaved handsome enough to lay an egg every day,
without missing Sundays.
</p>
<p>
All this hubbub and tumult arose in consequence of the great influx of
visitors to inspect, as far as the walls would allow them, the Doctor's
establishment at Nabbfield; to see the house where Mr. Skinwell had died,
and the churchyard wherein his remains had been deposited. Nor did it in
any material degree become lessened for several weeks after.
</p>
<p>
It is not my purpose to give the details of this singular trial, or to
follow through all its various ramifications that mass of strong
circumstantial evidence which the industry of the lower members of the
executive had accumulated. This is already sufficiently made known to the
reader in the scenes through which he has passed with me during the
earlier portions of this history. Neither is it needful to state more on
the other side, than that a most elaborate and able defence was made by an
eminent counsel retained on the part of the prisoner;&mdash;a defence
which in many respects had the effect of turning the heads of the jury of
Yorkshiremen exactly the contrary way to that wherein they had viewed the
case before.
</p>
<p>
At length his lordship summed up in an address to the sagacious body last
mentioned, which occupied more than three hours in the delivery; after
which the jury retired to cogitate upon the matter during a space of
several hours longer. The first result of this was, its being signified to
the court that they could not agree to a verdict. Farther deliberation was
insisted on; and after about four hours more study and riddling of the
matter, unanimity in opinion was obtained. They returned into court a few
minutes before midnight, and before a breathless audience pronounced a
verdict of <i>Not Guilty.</i> No sooner was it uttered, than the prisoner
himself dropped insensible in the dock. The people in the court murmured.
The words Not Guilty were instantaneously repeated on the stairs, and
again outside, like magic. They ran with the rapidity of lightning down a
wire, firing nearly every bosom present with indignation. The multitude
almost yelled for the murderer's blood. But the verdict had gone forth,
and a jury of his countrymen had pronounced him innocent. They cried for
him to be brought forth and set at liberty amongst them; while some more
desperately threatened to wait till he came out, to sentence him over
again, and execute him on the spot. The time of night, the darkness that
reigned above and around, the fearful passions of the mob now aroused in
some instances almost to frenzy by communication and collision, all
combined to render the scene that almost immediately ensued, one never to
be forgotten by those who witnessed it.
</p>
<p>
Under all the circumstances of the case, it will not, for an instant, be
supposed that Dr. Rowel was set at liberty that night. For his own sake
there was but one course to pursue, and that was, to detain him within the
precincts of the castle, in order to ensure his safety, and on the morrow
to convey him privately away at an hour too early for the public to be
made aware of his departure. Afterwards the crowd outside, evincing no
disposition to disperse, was driven away by the aid of the police. Some of
them, however, disappointed in this, assembled again, almost as though by
common consent, at some little distance outside the walls of the city, and
nigh a convent of nuns, which stands by the side of the Leeds road. The
cry here soon became &ldquo;For Nabbfield!&rdquo; The spirit of destruction had arisen
amongst them, and the fierce threat of fire had succeeded that of blood.
</p>
<p>
In the dead of night, under a black heaven that prevented almost anything
being seen, a dense press of men moved rapidly but stealthily off along
road, field, or farm, over river, fence, or garden, in a direction that
offered the straightest line between York and Nabbfield. Scarcely a word
was said, or an audible breath drawn, during this fearful march; though
many were the heavy, pointed stakes drawn from the hedges in their path,
many the rails and branches torn down, and converted silently into clubs,
as they proceeded. The dire determination of mischief, mistaken for
justice, which existed in more than a hundred breasts, seemed gathered
into one fierce, dark power, hurrying headlong and irresistibly to its
work of desolation, if not of death.
</p>
<p>
Their outset had not been observed from the city; and none, save, perhaps,
some late and solitary farm servant, peeping fearfully from her lighted
window when the dog barked, and the tramp and crash were heard as they
passed below, knew of them on their road; and even then a few minutes'
wonder who they were, and what they were going to do, followed perhaps by
a dream of farms on fire, or poaching conflicts in the woods, was all that
ensued. But nobody followed them. Like a meteor that falls unseen when the
world is asleep, that little band was only known to have been by the trail
of destruction, the dint in the earth it left behind it. Once only in its
course was it distinctly recognised. In the very heart, as it were, of
deep and peaceful sleep, the Hall of Kiddal was startled by a great and
prolonged shout beneath its walls&mdash;a huzza three times repeated from
above a hundred tongues, in which the names of Woodruff, Lupton, and Colin
were distinctly heard; and in the next moment all was again as still as
though spirits had given birth to those sounds, and then fled upon the
next blast that whistled by.
</p>
<p>
In comparatively a brief time afterwards, the walls of Nabbfield were
scaled; the gardens were trampled down, the trees uprooted, and the ponds
in them drained dry. All this was done in silence: the place still slept
in imagined security. But next came the thundering at doors, the tearing
down of shutters, the smashing of glass, and, amidst all this, the shrieks
and cries of the now-aroused inhabitants, though scarcely sensible from
fear, astonishment, and drowsiness. The battle had begun, and the invading
party had entered the premises.
</p>
<p>
Scattered up and down the house might now have been seen numbers of
exasperated and desperate men, with their faces blackened, and otherwise
disguised, so as to render recognition next almost to impossible. Their
first object seemed to be the seizure and security of the people who had
the establishment in charge and keeping; and as this task, since the
imprisonment of the Doctor, had devolved almost entirely upon his own
wife, the strong man Robson, with their usual assistants, and a few
additional ones, the force that had thus suddenly appeared against them
found little or no difficulty in effecting their object. Robson himself
had started up on hearing the noise produced by the first assault, and
made his way, half-dressed, into one of the lower rooms, where he soon
encountered half-a-dozen of the men already described. Thinking the
disturbance had arisen in consequence of some of the patients having
broken from their cells, he began to call upon them, in his usual manner,
to submit to their keeper, whom, he doubted not, they would instantly
recognise; but he was soon convinced of his mistake when he found himself
inextricably seized by many arms at once, and, at the same moment,
informed, by those who held him, that if he were not quiet, both in limb
and tongue, they should knock him in the head without any further
ceremony. They also told him they had come to destroy for ever that
execrable establishment, and to set all the people confined there free;
for it seemed to be the general opinion amongst them, that in the cases of
all those unfortunate persons, as well as in that of Mr. Woodruff,
injustice and robbery must necessarily have been committed, and not a
single lunatic was really to be found upon the premises.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Mrs. Rowel, the Doctor's wife, had contrived to escape out of
her room, and take refuge in a small outhouse, not far off; where, along
with two of her maids, she remained shivering with cold and terror until
all was over.
</p>
<p>
Many others of the assistants and dependants of the establishment having
been secured, a portion of the mob proceeded to pile up the furniture,
pictures, &amp;c., in the middle of the rooms, or to carry it out upon the
lawn in front of the house, and set it on fire; while others, having now
armed themselves with pokers, hammers, and other more effective weapons,&mdash;flew
to the various departments of the house, and, by main force, broke open
the cells and let out all such of the inmates as chose to avail themselves
of the privilege. Some of these escaped altogether into the woods, and
during several days after rambled wildly over the surrounding country,
until caught and again placed under confinement. Others were conveyed to
one of the stables, and securely fastened in, under the compulsory care of
Robson; while a few, it was believed, whose maladies rendered them either
incapable of knowing what was going on, or made them persist in remaining
in those melancholy places, which had now become all the world to them,
were burnt to death in the flames, which subsequently reached from the
blazing furniture to the building, and before an hour had elapsed from the
commencement of this extraordinary attack, enveloped the whole in one
sheet of fire.
</p>
<p>
I have before spoken of that shout of triumph which was heard at Kiddal
Hall, when this party of mistaken marauders passed by. It had the effect
not only of arousing Squire Lupton and all his household from sleep, but
also of inducing that gentleman to arise and endeavour to discover, from
his window, the men who had caused it. Nothing could be seen; but he
remained a long time to watch, and at length was startled by a red light
dimly appearing amongst the hills and woods in the direction of the
establishment at Nabbfield. By and by, as it rose higher and higher,
within the space of a very few minutes, he felt convinced that some
accident or other had happened, and feared lest, possibly, if that house
had taken fire, many unhappy lives would be sacrificed during the
conflagration. With a degree of rapidity, then, almost inconceivable, a
considerable force was mustered by him, and hurried off with an old
engine, in the direction of the place in question. But so rapidly had the
whole scheme been carried into execution, that, by the time of their
arrival, all hope of saving any part of the building was gone, and not one
single soul, of the many who had done the deed, remained to tell the tale.
With an unity of purpose, and a determination to finish their object,
equally as well (if well it can be called) as they had begun ft, the
little army of incendiaries had departed without leaving any trace whereby
their route could be pointed out and effectually discovered. Pursuers were
soon afterwards despatched in all directions, by the order of Mr. Lupton,
but not a single person was apprehended. And although, eventually, a
reward of five hundred pounds and a free pardon to any person not actually
guilty of the offence, was offered by the Government, in hopes of
discovering and bringing the offenders to justice, such was the feeling of
every individual concerned, however remotely, in the transaction, that no
clue was ever obtained at all likely to lead to their conviction. It was
also remarked, as a circumstance particularly worthy of note, that, as far
as could be discovered, no attempt at robbery had been made, as the plate
and other similar valuables, which the multitude had found, were thrown
into the fire along with every other more combustible and less costly
article.

<h2>
CHAPTER XI.
</h2>
<p>
<i>Strange morning doings.&mdash;Dr. Rowel returns to view the ruins of
his house.&mdash;The mysterious chest, and what was in it.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OTWITHSTANDING the personal violence which, it was to be feared, Doctor
Rowel might receive by making his appearance upon the scene of his former
crimes, he no sooner was informed of the total destruction of his
establishment, and of nearly all the property it contained, as related in
the preceding chapter, than he grew half frantic, and immediately declared
his resolution to visit the place, be the consequences of his temerity
what they might.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, in a state of excitement bordering closely on absolute
derangement, he set off from York on the following morning, in as private
and unobserved a manner as possible. The alertness, however, of the public
eye was too great to suffer him wholly to escape; and as he was driven at
a rapid pace through the streets of the city, the scornful hisses and
execrations of many of the people trebly increased his excitement, by
making him feel that most bitter of all feelings in its bitterest form&mdash;that
he had become despicable and odious in the eyes of his fellow men, and
henceforward could no longer hope to dwell amongst them, save as one
liable to be continually pointed at, to be shunned, perhaps plainly and
openly insulted, without any living creature looking upon him as worthy of
receiving pity.
</p>
<p>
On arriving at his late residence, he beheld only a black ruin in the
midst of desolation, with but one solitary object near it which had
survived the general destruction&mdash;and that was the old yew-tree under
which James Woodruff had passed so many weary years, and which now brought
back to the Doctor's eye, suddenly and completely, as might the drawing up
of a curtain, a perfect picture of all the past that had led to this sad
scene. The tree used to look black before, but now amidst greater
blackness and the smoke and ruin of the place it grew in, it looked green;
gaily green in the sunshine, as though even it rejoiced and felt glad over
the wild justice that had overtaken one guilty of so many crimes as was he
who once oppressed the helpless there unopposed. He could have hewn that
tree by the roots, for the thoughts it awoke in his mind, and wished it
burnt to a pillar of charcoal along with all else that was blasted and
calcined about it.
</p>
<p>
Outside was a throng of gazers, kept off partly by the rural constabulary,
and partly by some of the yeomanry of the district. These he hated for
their idle curiosity, their prying into other people's business; and could
he have had his will, would have swept the ground clear of them at one
stroke of his arm.
</p>
<p>
Standing on a rising knoll at some little distance, he recognised Squire
Lupton and James Woodruff, with his daughter Fanny, gazing over the ruins,
and watching with deep interest the progress of the workmen, who were
busily employed in recovering from the hot ruins as much of the property
on the premises as might have escaped with only partial or no damage. At
that sight&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;each passion dimm'd his face,
Thrice chang'd with pale ire, envy, and despair.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
He would have got out, but he dared not. He felt as though the people
would murder him, and cast him into the mouldering heaps of his own house.
</p>
<p>
Unrecognised in his carriage he was secure; and having drawn up pretty
closely to the spot where the last-named little party stood, he gazed with
an intensity of look almost indescribable upon the operations going on
amongst the ruins. It was plain that some strange idea had come into his
mind; it seemed written in his very features that something might be found
there which he would have no man know: a thing for his eyes only, and not
to be seen by such men as those.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But it was a wooden box,&rdquo; thought he again, &ldquo;and it must be burnt. It
could not escape&mdash;it is not likely&mdash;not possible. No, no; not
possible.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And yet, as he comforted himself thus, that possibility was still standing
on his brow as plainly as did the mark on Cain's:&mdash;the mark that told
ineffaceably before heaven and earth his guilt, and warned every man he
met to shun him.
</p>
<p>
Still the workmen worked, and he still gazed. At last they carried out on
a hand-barrow a heap of broken furniture, of partly destroyed boxes, and
pictures shrivelled like a parched scroll. Somebody standing by now
observed to his neighbour that the face of that man in the carriage was
frightful.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Tis it!&mdash;'t is it!&rdquo; exclaimed the Doctor, fiercely, madly, with
hysteric passion, unconscious of what he said and did. At the same time he
dashed his fist with the force of a stone through the glass of the window;
and having rapidly opened the door, rushed distractedly past all
impediments up to the men in question.
</p>
<p>
This sudden apparition,&mdash;for scarcely less even in the midst of
daylight did it seem,&mdash;so completely astonished and alarmed the
people that all those along the course he took fled backwards in fear;
while those beyond the scene of action as earnestly pressed forwards to
ascertain what was amiss.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Lupton, James Woodruff, and Fanny, besides many others amongst the
crowd, almost instantly recognised the person of the Doctor; while the
first-named gentleman as instantly hastened after him in order at once to
know the cause of this wild proceeding, and to prevent, by the
interference of his magisterial authority, that mischief which else he
feared might soon ensue.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That 's it!&mdash;it's mine&mdash;my own!&rdquo; cried the Doctor, as he
literally threw himself upon a box of considerable dimensions, deeply
scorched but not burnt through, which the workmen carried. At the same
time he clasped his arms about it as though he would strain to carry it
away. The workmen interfered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Molest him not!&rdquo; said Mr. Lupton, and they desisted.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I swear it is mine!&rdquo; again exclaimed Mr. Rowel, on hearing the voice of
the Squire, &ldquo;and no man shall open it while I live. I'm innocent, for they
judged me so last night. People will destroy me, if it 's seen. They 'll
swear it is <i>his</i> body, if they see it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;What body?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Lupton in astonishment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Him!&mdash;&mdash;no, no; I did not do that! Him that died. You know, you
know. Everybody over the world knows now! They shall not open it; I 'll
die first. I defy them all!&rdquo; And again the insane Doctor endeavoured as
though to hide it out of sight with his arms and body.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Lupton saw in all this something more than exactly appeared upon the
surface; and accordingly, both as better for the Doctor himself, and more
consistent with his own duty in so remarkable a case, he commanded the
constabulary to seize and protect Mr. Rowel back to the carriage from
which he had come, and then to convey the mysterious box safely down to
Kiddal Hall.
</p>
<p>
In the execution of these orders, the Doctor made such a desperate
resistance, and raved so furiously and incoherently,&mdash;repeatedly
declaring he should be hanged to-morrow,&mdash;that they wanted to murder
him,&mdash;that the body was not distinguishable,&mdash;and that he was
haunted by a horrible spectre,&mdash;as pretty clearly evinced that his
mind had overshot the firm ground of reason, and had fallen into that same
fearful abyss of insanity from which it had been his profession to rescue
others; and on the plea of his having fallen into which, he had also so
cruelly practised, during many years, upon the unfortunate James Woodruff,
his relation.
</p>
<p>
Great force <i>was</i> required to secure and get him into the carriage;
and after that object had been successfully achieved, it was found
necessary to bind him strongly with such materials, applicable to the
purpose, as chanced to be within reach, before his conveyance in such a
vehicle could be considered safe. This having been done, he was, after
some delay, eventually driven off to the residence of his brother, on
Sherwood forest;&mdash;a place to which those friends who had attended him
on his trial, considered it most proper, in the present state of affairs,
to convey him.
</p>
<p>
During these transactions the excitement of the assembled multitude was so
great, that, but for the presence of the yeomanry, and the judicious
measures adopted by Mr. Lupton, it is to be feared the disorders of the
previous night would have been concluded by a yet more horrible
catastrophe, in the murder of the Doctor, in open day, upon the memorable
site of his own destroyed and now for eyer vanished establishment at
Nabbfield. This fearful consequence was, however, happily avoided: and all
danger being now passed, Mr. James Woodruff and his daughter Fanny again
joined company with Mr. Lupton, and followed, with agitated and anxious
feelings, in the wake of the great crowd that accompanied the conveyance
of the mysterious box to the Squire's own residence.
</p>
<p>
A short time after their arrival at the Hall, the three above-named
individuals, along with one or two other persons, whom Mr. Lupton
purposely admitted as witnesses on the occasion, retired into a private
room, situate in a remote part of the building, whither the chest had
already been carried, under the care of several officers, and remained
present while a heavy lock upon it was broken, and the uplifted lid for
the first time displayed, to other eyes than those of Mr. Rowel, a sight
so horrible, that even the strongest-nerved man present recoiled with
sudden fear, while Fanny uttered a loud shriek of terror, and fell
insensible into her father's arms.
</p>
<p>
Before them, huddled up, to make it fit into its otherwise too short
habitation, lay a corpse, the body and limbs of which had undergone
dissection, while the head and face, by some process of preparation and
injection, yet remained sufficiently perfect to exhibit such a distinct
resemblance to what must have been its appearance while alive, as left
upon the minds of the spectators not the slightest doubt but that they now
assuredly looked upon the remains of the unfortunate Lawyer Skin well!
</p>
<p>
By what motive the Doctor could possibly have been actuated in taking the
body from its grave could only be conjectured; and the most probable
conjecture made upon the occasion was, that he had done so in order so far
to destroy all traces of the poison which had been administered to him, as
to render any subsequent investigation&mdash;presuming such should chance
to be made&mdash;wholly useless for any purpose of crimination.
</p>
<p>
But why, having done this, he should still preserve so horrible an object,&mdash;and
to him, it might be presumed, one so particularly horrible,&mdash;few
seemed willing to attempt to divine. Perhaps, what Shakespeare has said of
sorrow, we may best, in this instance, say of conscious guilt:&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;'T was one of those odd things <i>crime</i> often shoots
Out of the mind.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
Whatever the cause, however, the fact itself was there most plainly
proved; since the remains in the box were subsequently identified, not
only by Fanny Woodruff and Mr. Sylvester, the deceased's former clerk, but
also by many persons in the village, who had known him intimately when
alive.
</p>
<p>
As no object could now be attained by keeping the body, it was, some time
afterwards, placed in its old coffin and re-interred, amidst the
marvellings and the pity of numerous rustic spectators.
</p>
<p>
Another most remarkable circumstance, however, remains to be recorded, in
connection with this event, before I conclude this chapter; as it may also
serve, with the above, in some degree, to illustrate Doctor Rowel's
strange conduct and exclamations touching the chest, in the scene recently
described.
</p>
<p>
Placed immediately beneath the head of the corpse, and forming, in fact, a
rest for it, was found a much smaller, though far more antique and
curiously ornamented box than the one already described; and which,
eventually, proved to be the identical one wherein the title-deeds of the
estate of the Woodruffs of Charnwood had been kept during many
generations. On being opened, it was found still to contain them precisely
in the same state in which Mr. Rowel had so many years ago possessed
himself of them, after securing the person of their legitimate owner. The
effects of Mr. Skinwell's conduct in resisting the Doctor's solicitations
to co-operate dishonestly with him in altering or destroying those
writings, (as previously recorded,) now became apparent; and deep, indeed,
was the regret of all, that through such conduct he had, in all human
probability, come to such a frightful end.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Woodruff having then taken them again into his own custody, all
matters connected with the affair were settled in the best manner
circumstances would allow; and after a brief interval from the period now
spoken of, he and his daughter set out on their first journey, again to
behold and to take possession of their hereditary home.
</p>
<p>
On their arrival, however, they found it inhabited, under rent of Doctor
Rowel, by tenants whom the reader will feel no less surprised than was
Fanny to find there.

<h2>
CHAPTER XII.
</h2>
<p>
<i>A meeting, and a parting. Being one of the most agreeable, pathetic,
and loving chapters to be found in this great history.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>O long period of observation was required after Colin's arrival at Mr.
Calvert's, to enable him to discover that deep anxiety, and care, and
watchfulness, now reigned throughout that house touching her, his own
beloved, who so lately was as its life-spring and delight. The absence of
joy, if not the positive presence of melancholy, was visible in every
countenance. The voices that spoke, spoke in a lower tone than formerly;
while those of Mr. and Mrs. Calvert were seldom heard at all. The blinds
of the windows seemed to be permanently kept more than usually low;&mdash;unconsciously,
perhaps, on the part of the inmates of the place; but, then, that little
circumstance agreed with the general tone of their feelings, and so it
became as it were natural. He also observed, that though it was that
precise time of day when a canary bird that hung in the sitting-room
usually sang so gladly as to make itself heard nearly over the whole
house, the singing bird was now mute. A piece of white muslin that had
been thrown over his cage many hours ago to keep off the sun, had ever
since been forgotten. It kept him silent; yet strange enough, nobody
appeared to miss his singing, nor to think a moment of the little ruffled
and discontented heap of living music that fretted in gloomy silence
beneath.
</p>
<p>
At length, Jane, who, he had previously been informed, had lately confined
herself almost wholly to her own chamber, was introduced by her sister;
the latter having, with careful consideration, already cautiously
communicated to her the fact of the arrival of her brother Roger, and of
Colin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How changed!&rdquo; thought Colin as his spirit absolutely shrank at the first
sight of her. &ldquo;How like a creature whose heart is gone,&mdash;all whose
ties to the world are rapidly loosening, and who soon must be caught back
to the earth, or the chance will be lost for ever.&rdquo; In her face was
written, as all might read, that <i>the past</i> was all of a pleasant
existence she should ever look upon.
</p>
<p>
Yet when she saw him,&mdash;though all the family was around,&mdash;though
all eyes were upon her,&mdash;though the father looked solemn, and the
mother half chidingly; she at once flew towards him with the joy of a lark
upwards. For what was all the world besides,&mdash;its thoughts, and
sayings, and opinions,&mdash;what were they now to her? Nature was nature
in her bosom,&mdash;pure, frank, and virtuous; and her feelings those
which Heaven had planted there for the wisest, the best, and the happiest
purposes.
</p>
<p>
At this affecting sight her mother sobbed aloud; Mr. Calvert turned away,
and pressed the tears back into his eyes in silence. Her sister seized her
hands in hers, and as she pressed them with a loving pressure entreated
her to be composed. Her elder brother sat mute, looking seriously on the
floor; while honest Roger, himself, with the tears bursting from his eyes,
struck his hand upon the table, in a sudden agony of goodwill, and
exclaimed,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She <i>shall</i> have him, I say!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
The plainness and oddity of this declaration contrasted so comically with
the occasion upon which it was made, that scarcely a single person present
could forbear smiling; while, certain it is, that every one, not excepting
even the most obstinately opposed to that event, felt a sudden conviction
that Roger's words would somehow or other eventually come true.
</p>
<p>
But as suddenly as that conviction flashed across the mind, so, with
respect to Mr. and Mrs. Calvert, did it as suddenly again cease. For
though, during some few brief moments of promise which the temporary
excitement of their feelings had produced, they felt half inclined to
relent, and to endeavour to make the best of those circumstances which it
seemed in vain any longer to oppose; yet, as the cause of that sudden
conversion lost its temporary influence, they fell back upon former old
objections with almost increased prejudice; just as in many other cases
people will adopt a new doctrine for awhile, but when the particular
circumstances that caused them to do so are removed, will as surely return
with additional liking to their old and familiar opinions.
</p>
<p>
Long and curiously did these two afterwards discuss the matter, and how
finally it should be settled; while Colin and Jane, with a far less
expenditure of sage remarks and clever suggestions, were rapidly settling
it in good earnest without any discussion at all. There were no &ldquo;pros&rdquo; and
&ldquo;cons&rdquo; with them; no question about conventional proprieties; nor any
considerations as to what the world might, or might not think, in
reference to them. Enough for Jane that Colin was, in his own person and
mind, all that a young man should be, to be loveable and deserving of
love; and for Colin, that Jane seemed to merit more than the utmost of
what it was possibly in his power to bestow.
</p>
<p>
While the last named pair regarded the question as altogether one of the
heart, and into which no other conceivable interest should be allowed to
intrude, the parents of Jane held it as totally a question of the head, or
imagined right or wrong, and of propriety or impropriety, so far as the
maintenance or the sacrifice of their own peculiar opinions might possibly
be involved. But inasmuch as even the worst philosopher may venture most
safely to back the heart against the head in any contention of the kind
here spoken of, the reader will not feel surprised to learn that Colin and
Jane would certainly have triumphed, had it not unluckily happened that
some time before their forces could be brought perfectly to bear, Mr.
Calvert one day sent a message to Colin, requesting his company in the
former gentleman's study, and on his appearance delivered to him the
following very disheartening and painful speech:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;After what has occurred, Mr. Clink, since your return to town, and from
the scene it was our painful fortune to witness between you and my
daughter on your arrival here, I feel a firm conviction, which every day
serves to strengthen, that the time has arrived when it becomes my duty as
a father to come to some positive and decisive determination in this
matter. Much as I respect Mr. Lupton, for notwithstanding his deep
indiscretions, upon which it is not my duty to pronounce any judgment, I
yet know him to be in many respects most highly deserving of esteem; and
worthy and deserving a young man as I certainly think you yourself to be,
yet there are causes which from the first made me fearful, when I found
your preference for Jane, that a continued acquaintance between you could
not lead to any happiness. I shall not allude to those causes in any more
direct manner, for you probably can judge sufficiently what I mean,
without the necessity for any more explicit statement.&rdquo;

</h4>
<p>
Poor Colin here blushed crimson and bowed his head down, as Mr. Calvert
proceeded:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But with my habits of thinking, and the principles I have always
cherished from my boyhood, it would be inconsistent with my usual
practice, were I to hold those causes as too light to be regarded as an
obstacle to your ultimate views. To me they are of every importance: I
might more properly call them insurmountable difficulties. And though I am
perfectly aware that such matters are too frequently regarded with
careless, and, as I take it, with criminal indifference, yet I hold them
as so far affecting in themselves the moral principles of society, as so
far contrary to the dictates of religion, and to the obligations due to
the more correct portions of the community, that I feel, painful and
bitter as is the task, I feel compelled thus plainly and distinctly to
declare my sentiments to you in the hope that, after having so done,
nothing more will be required in order to assure you of the course which
it is most necessary for me to wish you at once and immediately to adopt.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Colin, as his heart seemed to swell into his throat and almost
prevent him speaking, &ldquo;I cannot, sir, but respect your motives, and feel
more deeply how much <i>I</i> shall lose if I am under the necessity of
quitting this house and seeing those who are in it no more. I know what
your objections are,&mdash;they are not to be removed, and are
irremediable. I am what I am; and for myself I have no apology to offer,&mdash;no
excuse to make.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
He would have spoken more, but at that moment he could not.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; observed Mr. Calvert, &ldquo;do not mistake me. It is your misfortune,
not your crime: and for misfortune which no power of yours could ever
remedy, apology or excuse can never be demanded. It was my hope some time
ago that Jane and yourself might possibly dissolve this acquaintance
yourselves, when my sentiments and those of her mother and family were
made known to you both; and thus render such an explanation as the present
needless. But I have been mistaken: and in permitting that farther
communication which I foolishly hoped would terminate itself, we have only
fastened the bands more tightly, and increased the probabilities of pain
on that after-separation, which, difficult as the words are to me to
speak, I still am compelled to say, <i>must</i> be effected. We cannot go
on thus any longer. Even now it is a question of every importance to you
both. To my poor dear daughter it may soon become a question of life or
death. The possibility of such a result must be averted. The step must be
taken in time. Though the blow be painful it must be struck. Nevertheless,
when you are gone, carry with you the assurance that I still continue,
along with all my family, to think honourably of you,&mdash;to remember
your worthiness,&mdash;to look with melancholy pleasure upon the time when
we could entertain you personally under our roof,&mdash;and to regret to
the last hour of our lives that so unhappy an ending should have come to
the young affection of one whom it would have been our delight, if
possible, to have blessed with the good creature&mdash;for such my Jane is&mdash;the
good and worthy creature he had sought.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
So saying, Mr. Calvert pressed Colin's hand energetically during several
minutes.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Bless you, my friend!&rdquo; added he, as he gazed upon the heart-broken youth
beside him,&mdash;&ldquo;Bless you!&mdash;Even now I cannot part with you
without betraying more than becomes me as a father in such a case.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And as he falteringly uttered these words, his eyes confirmed them with
nature's purest token of severed friendship.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Your worthiness,&rdquo; at length replied Colin, &ldquo;makes me, sir, lost what to
say. Had you treated me harshly I could have replied; but as it is, I feel
still the more bound by the very efforts made to shake me off. If you will
have it so, sir, I know not how to oppose: though certainly it is
impossible for me ever to comply. Not by that, that I mean to say the
wishes of so worthy a man shall not be carried out as far as Heaven will
give me power to do it: but though <i>I</i> go away never to return more,
believe me, sir, my heart will be left with those I leave,&mdash;I shall
do my best to forget where I am,&mdash;to inhabit this place still in
imagination, and live out my life at least with the memory of her whom I
am forbidden to know in any other manner.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Endeavour to be reconciled,&rdquo; observed Mr. Calvert; &ldquo;and remember that
even the most favoured cannot say that this world was made for happiness.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Colin bitterly,&mdash;&ldquo;it is not indeed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; rejoined his worthy friend, &ldquo;that on neither side shall we
ever cease to feel pain on this subject; but it will be our duty to bow
with humility before those decrees which we cannot escape, and to
endeavour to persuade ourselves that everything may possibly be after all
for the best.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It cannot, sir,&rdquo; replied Colin in the agony of his spirit; &ldquo;it can never
be for the best that we should be separated for ever! It is impossible.
For however well it may be for others, to us it can be nothing but
inevitable misery.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do not speak thus, my young friend,&rdquo; answered Mr. Calvert; &ldquo;I am myself
an old man, and have many times found in the course of a long and not
uneventful life, that out of those circumstances which at the time of
their occurrence promised nothing but unhappiness, the unseen agency of
Providence not unfrequently deduced consequences the most important to our
future welfare. Just as, on the contrary, we often find that the fairest
promise of happiness ends in the least practical result; and at the bottom
of the sweetest cup we find the bitterest dregs.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Colin was about to reply, but Mr. Calvert waved his hand as significant
that he would add a few more words.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;but that under this, to you, most dire of
disappointments may lie hidden the cause of all your future happiness?
Unseen, it doubtless is to you now, and difficult perhaps of being even
imagined. But inasmuch as no man can foresee what is in store for him, nor
predicate from things present of things to come, it is at once the wisest
way and the most in accordance with our faith and dependence upon
Providence, to make ourselves willing to accept as the best possible good,
with reference to our future welfare, those fatalities of life which no
endeavours of ours can possibly avert. Be comforted; and strive both to
forget the past and to believe the present and the future more rife with
satisfaction than, under the influence of your existing excitement of
feeling, they else might appear.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now, having, as I hope, settled this matter in the best manner it
will allow of, let me add one more observation, and I have done. Under
every possible view of the case, and considering that no conceivable good
could come of a formal parting, I must beg of you to regard your
interview, this morning, with Jane as <i>the last</i>. It is better that
you do not see each other again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, sir, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Colin, &ldquo;you cannot mean that. It is
impossible. When I left her but now to come to you, I had not half told
her what I intended to say, and I promised to be back again as soon as I
had seen you. She begged of me not to be long, because with all her grief
she could not bear to be alone. I must go, sir; if it be only to say one
good-b'ye,&mdash;just one,&mdash;and no more!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Better not,&rdquo; faltered Mr. Calvert, half between a smile and a tear.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&mdash;yes,&mdash;you will 'not deny us that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Calvert's lips quivered, but he said nothing.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I am made unhappy for ever, now!&rdquo; added Colin.
</p>
<p>
After a pause Mr. Calvert replied, &ldquo;Then you must see her in my presence,
if at all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Anywhere!&rdquo; exclaimed our hero gladly; &ldquo;but let me see her again.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Jane was now sent for. When she entered the room, Colin could no longer
restrain himself. The sight of her made him burst into tears.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Jane, my girl,&rdquo; began the father as he took her hand, and led her gently
beside his own chair; &ldquo;I hope you will sustain yourself for a few moments,
while I simply explain to you that Mr. Clink and I have had some
conversation upon the same subject as that upon which your mother has
already spoken to you. The matter is now finally settled. But Mr. Clink
wished, before he went, to bid you a good-b'ye for the last time; as you
part friends with him, the same as, from my heart, I can say <i>I</i> do;
and not for myself alone, but in the name of all the family.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Jane could not speak, but her pretty throat swelled like that of a
nightingale that dies, as poor Keates describes it, &ldquo;<i>heart-stifled</i>
in its dell.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; at length she whispered, &ldquo;it is not&mdash;is not&mdash;<i>true!</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Calvert remained fixed and mute as a statue.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It cannot be true!&rdquo; continued Jane; &ldquo;you would never&mdash;never make me
so miserable! I do not believe it&mdash;I cannot!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At length her father spoke.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; said he, with a solemnity which he could not help, and of
which he was not himself conscious; &ldquo;you <i>must</i> endeavour to be
resigned. As you love me, let me beg of you to calm yourself, and
endeavour to seek in prayer to Heaven that comfort which I never thought
to see a child of mine so much in need of. You want peace of mind, child.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I <i>do</i>, father!&rdquo; she exclaimed, wringing her hands; &ldquo;no poor soul
more than I.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Another pause ensued here, during which Colin clasped Jane's other hand,
as though when that one grapple was over, the world would be lost, and he
should sink for ever. His eyes were on her face, but he could not see.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; added Mr. Calvert, half-chokingly; &ldquo;do not prolong this scene.
We can do no more. Bid each other a loving good-b'ye, and be that kiss the
last.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I cannot!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane, hysterically; &ldquo;I <i>cannot!</i> Father! I love
him, and <i>shall</i> love him everlastingly. You will not part us, I
know. He will never leave me&mdash;never! Oh no! no, no, no!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And poor Jane fell into a fearful convulsion, that made all cheeks pale
and eyes wet for mere pity at her trouble.
</p>
<p>
This event brought others of the family into the room, and amongst them
Colin's best friend, Roger. No sooner did he see what had happened, than
his spirit and his feelings were at once aroused.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; he exclaimed passionately, though without addressing any one
in particular,&mdash;&ldquo;I tell you, you will kill the girl if you go on in
this way with her!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And then Jane was carried away and placed on her pretty white bed, and
tended carefully by her mother and her sister and her waiting-maids, until
life came reluctantly back again, and she waked once more into the
consciousness of misery.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Is he gone, mother?&rdquo; she demanded in the first faint tones that conscious
animation supplied to the tongue; &ldquo;is he gone?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, my dear, he is not gone; nor is he going yet,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Calvert.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's right!&mdash;that's right!&rdquo; she exclaimed. And then, as she looked
her parent earnestly in the face, she asked&mdash;&ldquo;Mother! do you remember
how <i>you</i> ever loved my father?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
That little simple appeal was irresistible, as a world of tears soon
testified.
</p>
<p>
After that Jane grew calmer, and sat up with her mother and sister to
catch the air from an opened window that looked through a nest of vine
leaves into the garden.
</p>
<p>
Meantime Roger Calvert, his father, and Colin, had further conversation
below stairs, which ended in producing a determination on the part of
Colin and his friend of great interest as well as importance in our
history, but which will be farther explained in another chapter.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIII.
</h2>
<p>
<i>Reveals various curious particulars; of which the mysterious
disappearance of Jane is not the least.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the desperate state of things implied by the proceedings last recorded,
it will not be marvelled at that measures equally desperate should have
been projected by Colin in conjunction with his friend Roger; though
eminently calculated, provided they could but be carried out, to bring him
that final satisfaction which it appeared impossible for him to attain
through any other more moderate course.
</p>
<p>
Roger's general conduct towards Colin, throughout the affair, had inspired
the latter with every confidence in him, and the certainty of being able
to command his services in any enterprise which had the happiness of Jane
and himself for its object. Nothing indeed but that confidence could
possibly have induced Colin to take the earliest opportunity that offered,
after the scenes described in the preceding chapter, to draw Mr. Roger
Calvert into an unobserved part of the house, and propose to him that they
should settle the matter at once and for ever in a manner already
suggested,&mdash;that is, through the medium of an elopement during the
night. Colin argued that it was now sufficiently evident he had no chance
of succeeding unless by resorting to that gentle violence just alluded to.
He contended that Mr. and Mrs. Calvert would never give way without it,&mdash;that
if once done it would afford them a capital excuse for reconciling
themselves to the match, when such reconciliation had become a matter of
necessity, without involving them in any of that unpleasant compromise of
principle, as they supposed it, which at present constituted the great
obstacle to their union.
</p>
<p>
He even ventured to suggest, that very possibly if they <i>could</i> be
made aware of his projected attempt, they would secretly feel inclined to
connive at it,&mdash;seeing that at least Jane's happiness would be for
ever destroyed, if even her very life were not sacrificed, were not
something done to avert those consequences of parental opposition which
now seemed to hang over them. As for himself&mdash;without her, happiness
for him in any situation, or under any circumstances, was totally out of
the question. He felt assured of the impossibility of his living other
than a miserable life, and dying a death at last which disappointment and
misfortune had rendered welcome. He concluded by beseeching his friend, as
he knew his honourable intentions, as he recognised the justice of his
suit, and felt at once for his sister's unhappiness and his own, to give
him his support and assistance in carrying out such a project.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should decidedly say,&rdquo; replied Roger, &ldquo;you have good cause for eloping
under the circumstances&mdash;that is, supposing Jane herself has no
objection; and I assure you it is what I myself should do in the same
situation.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Thus supported, Colin entered on his design with increased alacrity and
spirit; but as his final leave of Jane was now understood to have been
taken, he had no ready means of communicating with her upon the subject,
except through the agency of her brother Roger. He, however, very readily
undertook the task of informing his sister of the design, as he considered
it absolutely scandalous that the happiness of two young people's lives
should be utterly blighted simply because her parents entertained notions
which, however conscientious, by no means (in his opinion) could justify
for a moment their perseverance in measures of so important and violent a
character.
</p>
<p>
It was, therefore, agreed between them, that, in order the more
successfully to carry on their plan, Colin should that night take a
respectful leave of the family under the impression, on their parts, of
never seeing him again; but that, instead of quitting London, he should
only retire to some hotel, or to a friend's house, where he could remain
until such time as matters were arranged for his and Jane's departure
together. This accordingly he did, quitting Mr. Calvert's house not
without considerable grief on the part of all who dwelt beneath the roof,
except Roger himself, though, on Colin's own part, with such a poor,
miserable exhibition of sorrow, considering the unfortunate situation in
which he was placed, that the good Calverts were quite astonished thereat,
and, after he was gone, began very strongly to suspect that, after all,
there was not half the feeling and excellence in him they had previously
been led to believe. He had not produced even a single tear on the
occasion; while Mrs. Calvert spoke almost positively to a certain
something like a smile lurking about his mouth, which she had observed at
the very moment when her husband had so feelingly remarked to him that,
while he wished him well on earth, perhaps the next time they met it would
be in heaven. Yet the hard-hearted young man did not seem so much as to
think of crying even at that, but actually took it as coolly as though he
were going to meet them all again in the course of two or three days from
that identical night. These things certainly had a strange look, though
they might possibly be the result, not so much of indifference, as of an
heroic determination, on his part, to disguise his sorrows until the
painful trial was over. Roger was appealed to for judgment in the case,
but he professed to have no power over other men's bosoms, nor ability in
discovering the profundities of their springs of action. But the truth of
the matter was, that while Roger enjoyed excellent reasons within himself
for keeping the secret, he also felt materially disinclined for
conversation. The departure of his friend had put a seal upon his tongue;
while it had likewise rendered him uncommonly anxious to see how his
sister Jane bore it, and to offer her such consolation under the
circumstances as might chance to lie in his power.
</p>
<p>
When, at length, Roger went to see her, he found her sitting alone, as she
had particularly begged to be left, looking more like a spirit in the
twilight than an embodied creature.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Jane!&rdquo; said he, as he entered the room and advanced towards her. She
started astonished&mdash;almost affrighted. That one word had come upon
her like a thunder-clap. It had awakened her from a reverie or a dream&mdash;suddenly
snatched her, as it were, from a world of her own sad imagination back to
the still sadder world of nature about her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;who is it?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Only I,&rdquo; replied Roger. &ldquo;Dry your eyes directly, there's a good girl. I
have something to tell you that I hope will make you glad. I told you
before that you should have him, after all.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;&rdquo; cried Jane clasping her hands, &ldquo;has my father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, no; not that,&rdquo; rejoined her brother; &ldquo;but something that will do
quite as well. Only you must speak low and let nobody hear, or else we
shall spoil the whole business. Colin and I have settled it altogether
between us. You <i>must</i> do it, you know, for your own sake as well as
his, and do not hesitate a moment about it. I'll tell you plainly what it
is,&mdash;you must give your consent for Colin to run away with you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Jane shook her head.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You <i>must</i>,&rdquo; repeated Roger; &ldquo;there is no other mode of managing it:
<i>I</i> will go with you, and we will all three fly down to Mr.
Woodruff's house, where we will have a parson to marry you directly, so as
to make the matter safe; and then father and mother, and everybody else
may make the best of the matter they can!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do not play with me,&rdquo; said Jane; &ldquo;I cannot indeed bear it now!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never was more in earnest in my life!&rdquo; exclaimed Roger, emphatically;
&ldquo;I tell you it is all settled, and you <i>must</i> do it, whether you like
it or not. I won't see your happiness sacrificed for the want of a little
spirit on your part when it is so much required. Look here&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And Roger drew forth a letter which Colin had hastily indited before
taking his leave, and confided to him to deliver to his sister at the
earliest opportunity.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is a note from Colin upon the subject, which I dare
say you will not refuse to read.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is too dark,&rdquo; answered Jane; &ldquo;besides I dare not. What <i>would</i>
they all think of me if I were to listen to such a proposal as this?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Roger; &ldquo;they would think a great deal better of you
after it was all over, than ever they could think of themselves, if they
should have to put up for you a tablet in the church, with an inscription
that you had died of disappointment brought on by their own rigour. Here,
take it, and I will fetch you a lamp to read by.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Jane took the letter, and her brother hastened out to fulfil his
intention.
</p>
<p>
The moment he was gone, Jane rose with uncommon alacrity and hastened to
the window. Yes, there was yet light enough to make most of it out,
although she thought it dark not a minute ago. The letter said a hundred
sweet and happy things, such as she felt certain no man had ever said
before; such as even <i>he</i> had not ever thought of saying on any other
occasion. It promised as certain an easy reconcilement with all parties;
it told her he was sure of it, and bade her feel no fear. It visioned a
world of delight for the future, and represented its writer as lost
utterly, if she would not listen to her brother's advice and consent to
act upon it. And then it concluded with more love signified in half a
dozen little words than anybody else, she believed, could express in half
a volume.
</p>
<p>
When Roger returned, which he did speedily, with a lamp, &ldquo;I do not want
it,&rdquo; observed Jane, blushing to the forehead to be thus seen in the light,
though it was only by her brother and best friend.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What! won't you read it?&rdquo; demanded he.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It was light enough at the window,&rdquo; faltered Jane.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That's right!&rdquo; exclaimed Roger; &ldquo;I'll kiss you for that.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And so saying, he caught his sister in his arms, and told her how good a
girl she was for taking advice; at the same time promising not only to
steer her safely through, but to ensure the good will of her parents as
early after the business was concluded as possible.
</p>
<p>
But Jane still held out, and protested she dared not do it. And though her
brother brought all his powers of oratory to bear in the endeavour to
extort a promise from her, she persisted in her refusal, and at length
told him it was quite useless to say anything more to her upon the
subject.
</p>
<p>
Roger went away both puzzled and mortified; but within a few days
afterwards it was remarked by all the family that Jane seemed quite
astonishingly recovered from her melancholy. There was really a surprising
difference in her manners; and hope began to be confidently entertained
that in the course of a short time longer, she would have perfectly
recovered her painful disappointment, and become once again that same
pleasant creature she was before her eyes met those of Colin, but which
almost ever since she had so unhappily ceased to be. However, at the very
time when everybody expected and prognosticated that this desirable
consummation would be effected, at that precise period when all happy eyes
were again to be turned upon her with renewed gladness, then it was
discovered, to everybody's amazement, that she was missing; Roger too had
disappeared in a manner equally mysterious; nor was <i>Jane Calvert</i>
ever found again. A fact more remarkable than all.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIV.
</h2>
<p>
<i>A scene in a lady's chamber.&mdash;Before the Elopement, and after it.&mdash;Arrival
at Charnwood, and who was found there.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN our friend, Roger, first observed the change in his sister's spirits
more particularly alluded to above, he regarded it as an omen so much more
to be relied upon for its real significance than any words, that thereupon
he wrote to Colin at the place where he was waiting in expectation,&mdash;stating
the circumstances that had occurred, at full length; and insinuating that
if Colin felt inclined to adopt a bold course and prepare everything in
readiness for the expedition, he would engage, without any further delay,
to persuade his sister to fly with them about day-break on a certain
morning which he named. Mr. Clink, as may well be imagined, most eagerly
seized upon the opportunity. His heart was on fire. Now was everything to
be risked, and everything to be won. After the receipt of that letter he
could not sleep nor rest until the arrival of the eventful morning.
</p>
<p>
Roger had already contrived to get Jane's maid into his favour, and to her
was to be confided the duty of awakening her mistress and communicating to
her the first intelligence of the arrival of a carriage at the gate;
while, with his own hand, during the previous night, he not only secured
all the members of the family fast in their rooms, by tying the doors
outside, but also crippled the bell-wires in a manner so effectually, that
an alarm of the servants by those means was rendered impossible.
</p>
<p>
At the latest possible hour he communicated to his sister the fact that
everything was in readiness, and that Colin would be near the house before
sunrise on the following morning to set off with her and himself on their
journey to the house of Mr. Woodruff; that gentleman having already been
communicated with on the subject, and his consent obtained;&mdash;partly,
because he could refuse nothing to Colin, and partly, because his own
daughter had used her influence in persuading him there could not possibly
be any harm in affording such a refuge to the fugitives. This
announcement, together with the prospect it held out to her, made Jane
tremble all over and look full of fears; but Roger would not allow her to
protest anything against it, as he stopped her as the first words escaped
her lips, with the remark that nothing could possibly be said about it
now,&mdash;the time was come&mdash;the thing settled&mdash;all
arrangements made,&mdash;and she could not now do anything but prepare
herself for compliance at the perilous moment when she should be summoned
in the morning. So saying, he bade her good night, with an additional
declaration that he could not hear a word of denial.
</p>
<p>
If the truth were told, I should tell how all that night poor Jane's heart
throbbed incessantly, and sometimes, in correspondence with her thoughts,
leaped suddenly as if it would go out of its place, I should tell how she
never slept a single wink;&mdash;how earnestly she said her prayers, and
how long! How, after many hesitations, and at last with many tears, she
eventually put her trembling hand to the reluctant, yet loving, task of
putting up such trinkets and jewellery as could not be dispensed with,&mdash;while
her maid, as busy and as pleased as a summer bee, employed herself in a
similar task with her dresses. And then, when all was over, how she stood
silent awhile, looking on those places and around that room, which
to-morrow her mother should find empty, and which now for the last time
beheld her who had tenanted and adorned it from her childhood. That glass
might never look upon her face again, which had seen her beauty grow up
from pretty girlishness to perfect womanhood. That window would never more
have the same eyes through it that had become familiar there&mdash;nor
those leaves any more be put aside by the fingers that had so often saved
them unbruised, when the little casement was closed for the night. I
should tell how, as these and similar thoughts passed rapidly through her
mind, the tears stole silently down her cheeks until she sank upon her
chair, and declared, while she did so, that she should never have the
heart to go!
</p>
<p>
But the heart has a way of its own sometimes, and sudden courage on
occasion which it has not resolutions to contemplate beforehand. So, after
the night had worn away, and when the time came for flight,&mdash;before
yet the stars were gone, or any light more than a first dim gleam on a
black ground, was seen in the east,&mdash;she plucked up resolution to be
firm, but lost it again immediately, for the sound of a carriage wheels&mdash;<i>the</i>
carriage that was to whirl her away from her old home to a new life in a
new place&mdash;faintly but distinctly came upon her ear.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;'Tis he!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Truly, ma'am, I hope so,&rdquo; replied the maid, &ldquo;for I want to see you safe
off and happy.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Jane, in a whisper; &ldquo;listen, listen!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
In the next minute her brother Roger gently tapped at the door. It was
true. She must go, and no delay be made&mdash;not a moment's waiting. And
go she did; but in such a way, that when half an hour after she found
herself sitting beside her maid, with Roger and Colin opposite, and being
driven at a tremendous pace on the north road, out of the metropolis, she
could not remember how she had got down stairs, or walked to the carriage,
or who had helped her, or whether she had done so without any assistance
at all. But there she was, and of little else did she seem conscious. With
her lover matters were considerably different. Full of self-possession,
and elated in the highest degree, he felt then as though but one idea
existed to him in the world, and that one which may best be expressed in
the exclamation of one of Moore's angels&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;'Tis done, 'tis done!
The gate is passed, and heaven is won!&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
Before we proceed to inquire how the fugitives sped after their arrival at
the end of their journey, it may interest the reader to be informed, that
they very narrowly escaped detection and pursuit, in consequence of an odd
accident, that happened through their very precautions to be safe; and
which, had it unfortunately occurred some hour or two earlier, would
inevitably have frustrated their design.
</p>
<p>
Very early in the morning, and before the family had arisen, the
house-dogs began barking most furiously, which, from some unknown cause,
rang an alarm from cellar to garret, of the whole establishment. Both
servants and master were soon in motion, anxious to discover the cause of
this unusual hurly-burly. The latter looked first out of his window; but
discovering nothing, then attempted to ring his bell; whereupon the wire
dropped down into his hands, as it had very cleverly been unhooked by his
son Roger, from the crank outside, in preparation for any contingency of
the kind which now arose. He next tried his door, and was still more
astonished to find it secured outside, so that all egress was, for the
present, prevented. While this was going on, various others of the
household were going through similar operations, and discovering
themselves placed in similar predicaments until, at length, it became
generally believed throughout the house, that a gang of thieves must have
entered it, and converted the place into a temporary prison, in order the
better to effect their nefarious designs.
</p>
<p>
When, however, fortune had so far favoured them as to allow of an escape,
a search was instantly instituted; but still the cause of the disturbance
remained as unexplained as before.
</p>
<p>
By the time that every person under the roof had arisen and assembled,
under feelings of the most anxious inquiry, it was remarked by one or two
of the more sagacious and reflecting amongst them, that neither Miss Jane
nor Mr. Roger appeared to have been aroused by the same noise, which had
put themselves into such an extraordinary consternation. This fact
appeared unaccountable, for the rooms of both commanded as audible hearing
of any external commotion as any rooms on the premises. Some of them
cleverly imagined that the pair alluded to must have slept uncommonly
sound, and assigned as good reason for that belief, the fact of Jane's
previous ill health, and Roger's well known activity in all sorts of
laborious exercises; but while these last mentioned were speculating upon
probabilities, Mr. Calvert himself had hastened off to Roger's room, and
his eldest daughter to that of Jane, in order to ascertain from those two
individuals themselves the actual and <i>bona fide</i> state of the case.
What was their amazement to find both nests cold, and the birds flown! Mr.
Calvert felt so amazed at this discovery, that he was obliged to sit down
on the stairs a few minutes in order to recover himself; while his
daughter, with the natural feeling and action of a woman so circumstanced,
flew back again, the moment she discovered the deficiency alluded to,
screaming all the way she went, that Jane had been stolen away.
</p>
<p>
A good guess at the real truth instantly flashed across the mind of every
one present. A conspiracy, to which nobody but themselves were privy, had
evidently been entered into and executed by Jane and Colin, aided by
Roger, and all agreed, in their own minds, that, instead of ever seeing <i>Jane</i>
again, they should be, somehow or other, introduced to Mrs. Colin Clink.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Calvert, at first, took the thing in uncommon dudgeon, and ordered his
horses out to pursue the flying trio, but, by the time every saddle and
harness were got ready, it luckily chanced to be discovered that nobody
knew whether to prefer the east, west, north, or south quarters, in the
proposed search after them. Not the remotest clue could be obtained as to
which road they had taken. Probabilities, however, being in favour of
Kiddal Hall, Mr. Calvert and his son very shortly afterwards set out
together on a hurried expedition to that residence, in hopes of arriving
there and learning tidings of the runaways, in time to prevent that
marriage which, under his present feelings, Mr. Calvert felt determined
never to sanction, in any shape.
</p>
<p>
In the mean time Colin and his friend were making the best use of their
time, by a series of civil forced marches along the road, and beguiling
the hours thus occupied, by forming all sorts of ludicrous conjectures as
to the progress of events at the house from which they had so ably
effected their escape; thus endeavouring to rally Jane's spirits.
</p>
<p>
It was in the course of the following day that our little party had the
pleasure of beholding the walls within which they were to be made secure
of future happiness; secure, at least, so far as mutual affection, well
tried, and an earnest heart for each other's welfare, may be considered
capable of effecting that end. Thus felt Colin and his pretty companion,
while Roger regarded his first view of the house with remarkable interest,
since it also contained her who was everything to him, and with whom it
had long since been decided he should eventually join his fortunes, for
better and for worse.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Woodruff's residence was situated in one of the pleasantest portions
of Leicestershire.
</p>
<p>
It was one of those old, large, and substantial brick buildings, so
characteristic of a particular period of our domestic architecture, but
which can scarcely be better described, with their ornamental brickwork,
cornices, and mouldings, than by simply saying they convey an idea of
comfort, stability, and even of substantial well-doing, on the part of the
occupant, which is in vain sought for in any other class of either old or
modern erections. Its grounds were full of old and stately trees, which
almost seemed to speak their own dignity, and declare to the passer-by,
that beneath their branches had flourished some generations of the true
old English gentleman.
</p>
<p>
To this place were they most heartily welcomed by Mr. Woodruff and his
daughter, on their arrival.
</p>
<p>
It was on this occasion Colin learned, to his astonishment, from the lips
of Fanny, that her father and herself, on paying their first visit of
inspection to their newly-recovered property, found it occupied by the
family of that identical Miss Wintlebury whom he and she had so strangely
met in London, and of whom they both had reason to think so well. At the
mention of that name, Colin blushed so deeply that Jane felt sudden
misgivings as to his perfect fidelity, and, in a manner half joke, half
earnest, charged him with deception, either towards herself, or, perhaps,
to some now far less happy creature; an observation to which Colin could
not in any manner so well reply as by giving a brief statement of that
short story respecting Miss Wintlebury, with which the reader is already
acquainted, and which he did in a manner at once so frank, open, and
considerate, as instantly raised his general character very highly in
Jane's esteem. His own goodness of heart could not but shine through his
narrative, tinging even his errors, if such there were, with that warm
feeling of generosity as rendered them, if not amiable, at least certainly
not criminal.
</p>
<p>
Respecting Miss Wintlebury herself, Colin was happy to be informed that
she had materially improved in health; since, not only her residence in
the country, but likewise the widely altered circumstances in which her
father had placed her, assisted to throw in her way almost every possible
advantage that one in her situation could require. She still remembered
Colin's conduct with the most grateful feelings, and testified them by
entertaining his friends, Fanny and her father, in the best manner their
house could afford. Besides which, on Mr. Wintlebury being farther
informed of the particulars of their story in connexion with Doctor Rowel,
of which already he had heard much from common fame, he volunteered at
once to quit the premises he occupied and give Mr. Woodruff as early
possession of his own again as circumstances rendered possible.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, a short time afterwards he left it, and took a farm hard by;
after which the house and gardens were re-arranged in accordance with the
views of the proprietor, and he and his daughter entered upon its
enjoyment.

<h2>
CHAPTER XV.
</h2>
<h3>
<i>A wedding, a last interview, and a death.&mdash;Mrs. Lupton's funeral.</i>
</h3>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was a proud morning, a glorious day for Colin, when, with Jane Calvert
on his arm, he hastened to the little rural church which stood hard by Mr.
Woodruff's residence, there to pronounce openly what he had long felt in
his heart,&mdash;the sacred promise to love and cherish till death, in
sickness and in health, through weal and woe, the beautiful and good
creature beside him. Singularly enough, the bride was accompanied by the
two young ladies who, on one hand or the other, might each have been
expected to fill her place.
</p>
<p>
Fanny Woodruff and Harriet Wintlebury officiated as bridesmaids; one who
had loved him, and one whom he had loved. By both, however, was his
marriage with another looked upon with pleasure, since the altered
circumstances under which both were now placed, rendered envy or jealousy
incapable of finding a place in either breast.
</p>
<p>
The marriage ceremony was not yet wholly over,&mdash;the priest had just
uttered the solemn injunction, &ldquo;Those whom Heaven hath joined together let
no man put asunder,&rdquo;&mdash;when a stir was heard at the church door, and
Mr. Calvert and his son, in a state of great excitement, hurried in. The
former rushed towards the altar, and suddenly seizing his daughter Jane by
the arm, exclaimed, &ldquo;I forbid the marriage!&rdquo; The priest waved his hand as
signifying him to draw back, and pronounced before all present that Colin
and Jane were man and wife together, concluding with that blessing which
so beautifully finishes the Church ceremony on these occasions.
</p>
<p>
As the party retired in confusion and pain, Mr. Calvert approached them,
and taking the newly-made wife's hand,&mdash;&ldquo;Jane!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as you are
my daughter, I never expected this. However, I will not reproach you now.
The thing is done, and cannot now be undone. It is not for me to put
asunder whom God hath joined together: I <i>must</i> make the best of it
in my power, and therefore, seeing there is no remedy, let me join in the
blessing that has been pronounced, and ask of Heaven <i>that ye may so
live in this life, that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting</i>.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
At these words and this conduct, poor Jane burst into tears and wept
bitterly as she clung round her father's neck; while Colin stood by,
deeply affected both by the distress of his wife, and the manner in which,
at this last scene of all, Mr. Calvert had conducted himself.
</p>
<p>
Roger complimented his father and brother in a good-humoured manner upon
their being too late; and declared the uncommon gratification with which
he found them thus disappointed: while Fanny and Miss Wintlebury could not
refrain expressing in their countenances, if not in words, the sincerity
with which they joined in the young man's sentiments.
</p>
<p>
On the return of the whole party to the residence of Mr. Woodruff, Jane's
father informed them how he had, in the first instance, directed his steps
to Kiddal Hall, and thence to the place where he now was, in hopes of
arriving in time to prevent a marriage in which he did not, at that time,
acquiesce: and the more particularly did he feel objections upon the
occasion, as he found on his arrival at the Hall that his old acquaintance
and friend, Mrs. Lupton, was in a state of health that promised nothing
less than a speedy dissolution. Under those circumstances, he had felt
anxious at least to defer for awhile, if he could not finally prevent, the
ceremony which had that morning taken place. These intentions, however,
being now altogether frustrated, nothing remained but to endeavour to
reconcile matters finally with all parties interested therein, in the best
manner of which they were susceptible; and, in order to effect this, Mr.
Calvert deemed it needful that the newly-married pair should return with
him to Kiddal,&mdash;where, indeed, on receiving the intelligence of the
marriage, Mrs. Lupton afterwards most strongly invited them. This step he
considered the more advisable, because in case of the unfortunate lady of
that house desiring to see them before her death, their immediate presence
on the spot would prevent the otherwise possible contingency of her dying
wishes being disappointed.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, at an early and convenient period they set out; and, on their
arrival at Kiddal, were welcomed by the Squire with a degree of
satisfaction scarcely to be expressed sufficiently. A portion of the house
was, for the present, devoted entirely to their use; and, for awhile, a
degree of unmixed happiness would have reigned throughout that building so
unaccustomed to such scenes, but for the situation of Mrs. Lupton, who now
rapidly sunk under an accumulation of anxieties and grief, with part of
which the reader is already acquainted, but the great and unsustainable
weight of which no heart could ever truly know save her own.
</p>
<p>
At length, upon some inquiries that she herself had made respecting Jane
Calvert, it was cautiously communicated to her that she had married Mr.
Clink, and believed she should be as happy with him as their lives were
long.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;never! I feel this last blow deeply. Yet it
is useless&mdash;very useless. I might as well persuade myself to be
happy, only unhappily there is no such thing as a feeling left that will
be persuaded. Mary!&rdquo; And Miss Shirley approached her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whoever you live with when I am gone, be it with a woman. There is no
faith in any else; and none in her sometimes. That Jenny Calvert now&mdash;Well,
well,&mdash;I must see the young people&mdash;both of them,&mdash;and talk
to them myself. Let them be asked up now, for I cannot sit in this chair
much longer. I must see them.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Her wishes were shortly afterwards obeyed, and Colin and Jane were
conducted into Mrs. Lupton's apartment.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So you are married, Jenny?&rdquo; said Mrs. Lupton, as she took the young wife
by the hand and kissed her.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope we shall always be very happy,&rdquo; replied she.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;So <i>I</i> hoped once,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Lupton; &ldquo;and now see what has come
of it! Yet I loved him just as you may now; only I found there were other
women in the world besides me, just as I had persuaded myself that he
thought me the only one. That may seem strange to you, but it is plain
enough in itself, and a sad thing to think on.&mdash;Well! as it is so, my
dear,&mdash;love your husband: think him the best of men, living or dead,&mdash;the
handsomest,&mdash;the kindest,&mdash;the most worthy,&mdash;the only man
deserving of that curious treasure your whole heart. And even then,
perhaps, though all this be done,&mdash;you may fail to be happy, as
others have who have done quite as much before you. But it is best to do
it, as being your duty before heaven and in your own conscience.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And as for you, sir&mdash;&rdquo; said she, addressing Colin, &ldquo;look that you
never despise what you once loved; that you do not take up as a jewel what
you afterwards cast away as a stone. I have loved that girl from her
childhood; and now she is married, I would not have you do as some men do.
Take care of that. For if you do,&mdash;if you forget to look upon her
when she expects you,&mdash;if you leave her as an unwelcome thing in her
own house,&mdash;I tell you it will break her heart. I say you will break
her heart,&mdash;even as mine,&mdash;Heaven knows,&mdash;<i>is</i>
broken!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And so saying, Mrs. Lupton shrieked hysterically, and fell back
insensible.
</p>
<p>
Grieved to the soul, Colin and his wife retired in tears, while Miss
Shirley assisted in having the poor lady conveyed to her own room and laid
in bed, where such restoratives were resorted to as her case seemed to
require. When she had somewhat recovered&mdash;&ldquo;Walter!&rdquo; she exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Walter!
I want to see my husband.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
After a while Mr. Lupton entered the chamber, and all present retired into
an adjoining room.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Walter!&rdquo; said she faintly, &ldquo;I am going&mdash;but I wish to tell you I die
in peace&mdash;in <i>love</i> with you, even now. Very soon and I shall
trouble you no more. But if I can come back to you, I will. I have loved
and watched over you here&mdash;I will do so hereafter. You shall see me&mdash;but
do not be afraid, for I would not injure you even to gain heaven. Try to
be good for the future, and then perhaps we may meet again. I have lost
happiness here, but I hope for it to come. It is mine, I know it is!
Heaven will not make me miserable for ever, as I have endured so much.
Give me your hand&mdash;say one good kind word to me&mdash;nay, kiss me
truly, and I am content. See you! There about the bed angels are asking me
to come. I knew they would. I knew those blessed creatures would pity my
misery, and wait for me when the gate of the Everlasting was opened.
Heaven bless you&mdash;bless you!&rdquo; And as she uttered those words the
gripe of her hand on his became convulsive.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<i>I will come again!</i>&rdquo; she exclaimed with preternatural energy, as
she strove to rise up towards her husband, but sunk back dying,&mdash;dead,
in the effort.
</p>
<p>
If ever grief was in any house it was there on this occasion, when the
death of Mrs. Lupton became known. All the household, as well as those who
were not of it, flocked round the bed whereon she was laid, to weep in
truth and earnest heart over the corpse of one who had won all love from
all but him who should have loved her most&mdash;though from him she had
won it even at last when such love became useless. And if ever the living
felt truly that the dead should be strewn with flowers&mdash;&ldquo;sweets to
the sweet,&rdquo;&mdash;if ever it were felt that a funeral garment ought to be
decked with the choicest offerings of the garden, and the melancholy grave
be made beautiful,&mdash;assuredly was it felt then. Not one but felt that
a friend was lost,&mdash;that an emptiness existed in the bosom unknown
before, and never to be remedied; while some gave loose to that expression
of grief which tells us that all hope was gone with the departed, and that
the world had nothing more left in it for man to love, or by man to be
beloved.
</p>
<p>
Amongst those latter must be numbered Mr. Lupton himself. The words of his
dying wife had sunk deep into his soul&mdash;too deep ever again to be
eradicated. Misery had made him wise. Or, as Shakspeare has it&mdash;
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Being gone,&mdash;
The hand would call her back that pushed her on.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
But it was now too late. Nature's fiat had been pronounced, and man was
left to reconcile himself to her decree as best he might.
</p>
<p>
I shall not linger over this scene of death, save just to record how,
during some days, the body lay in solemn state in a certain room always
appropriated to that purpose; during which time it was looked upon by many
eyes that grew dim as they gazed, and spoken of by many a voice that
faltered and failed in the stifling effort to record the kindnesses and
virtues of the dead.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Lupton, it was observed, frequently haunted that room alone. There lay
a charm in it that he could not resist, and one that evidently day by day
gained power upon his mind.
</p>
<p>
Amongst other signs of his having become in some respects a changed man,
it was remarked that he gave strict orders that the private sitting room
of the departed lady should not under any circumstances be disturbed, but
that everything should remain exactly in the state in which she had last
left it. And so it remained. The very work-table stood open as when last
she had sat there; the snow-white muslin was thrown negligently upon it;
and there also lay the opened book with which, in some perhaps painful
moment, she had tried to beguile her weary heart, and to forget her own
too real sorrows in the imaginary joys described of another.
</p>
<p>
At length the night for the interment came. The doors which opened into
the court-yard, conducting to the little chapel, were thrown back upon
their reluctant hinges, and, amidst the uncertain and mingled light and
shadow produced by flickering torches, while all friends attended in a
black and mournful troop, the corpse of the Lady of Kiddal was carried in
and laid in like state beside the similar remains of many a fanciful
beauty and many a stalwart man who had laid down their beauty and their
strength, and gone in there before her.
</p>
<p>
Some time ere midnight the solemn ceremony was concluded, and the grave
doors were closed, not to be opened again, perhaps, until that widowed man
who now walked slowly from them should himself return, and, with the
tongue of death, demand a lodging there.
</p>
<p>
All gathered together in the great hall itself that night; and few, save
those to whom it was absolutely necessary to visit other portions of the
building, ventured out even with a light. The dead, somehow, seemed to
pervade every place under the roof, to have become endued, as it were,
with the principle of ubiquity, and to affright, with its presence, the
air of the whole house. The servants fancied they heard noises and
groanings, and took abundant pains to alarm one another with the most
horrible stories they could produce by the combination of memory and
invention. Neither, at last, did they retire to bed until, by common
consent, all had finished their work exactly at the same point of time, so
as to enable them to make their transit, from the great kitchen to the top
of the staircase, in one compact though small squadron.
</p>
<p>
Now, whether there be or be not any truth in the supposed appearance of
such disembodied forms as were here evidently dreaded to be seen, I shall
leave to the reader to determine for himself; but I am bound to relate a
curious occurrence which took place during the night, as being&mdash;I can
vouch for&mdash;a true part and parcel of this our history.

<h2>
CHAPTER XVI.
</h2>
<p>
<i>Relates what happened to Mr. Lupton on the night of the funeral.&mdash;Together
with some curious information respecting Longstaff, and Mr. and Mrs.
Samuel Pale-thorpe.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was late when Colin Clink and his wife retired to rest. Their apartment
lay in a snug recess formed by the projection outside of two tower-like
portions of the building, in one of which also his father's room was
situated.
</p>
<p>
Setting aside all melancholy and superstitious influences arising from the
mournful ceremony which, so short a time before, had taken place, the
night seemed sad and forbidding in itself. When he looked a few moments
from the window it was as though the blind, dead sky came close to the
panes. The landscape that lay far below appeared a black gulf, over which
the soughing of the wind sounded like the fitful panting breath, the
expiring complaints, of some vast unseen creature of the darkness, whose
existence might thus be shadowed to the ear, though not to the eyes, of
man. But when associated with the melancholy subject which weighed heavily
on all hearts, its influence became far more sensibly felt; and Colin
could not but feel as though nature had conspired with death to impress
the loss that had just been sustained more solemnly upon the mind.
</p>
<p>
During an hour or more after Mr. Lupton had retired, Colin indistinctly
heard his footsteps as he paced restlessly up and down the room, musing,
perhaps, on both long past and recent events, contrasting each, and
planning how the actions of his life, could that race but be run over
again, should assume a form and regulation different, in many things, to
those that had been.
</p>
<p>
Colin himself could not sleep, but lay awhile lost in thoughtful
abstraction, until at length he was startled by the sound of heavier and
more hasty feet in Mr. Lupton's chamber; just as though, in turning round,
a man should suddenly encounter one whom he did not wish to see, and
hastily fall back to avoid a closer meeting. A moment or two afterwards he
heard a heavy fall upon the ground.
</p>
<p>
Our hero instantly leaped up and hurriedly dressed himself again; but
before he had time to get out of his room, Mr. Lupton's bell had been
rung, and his valet summoned to him. Finding such to be the case, Colin
remained within his chamber. But shortly afterwards a knocking was heard
at his door, and on opening it he found the valet standing in fear
outside, and scarcely able to deliver in intelligible language the message
with which he was charged, desiring Colin, at Mr. Lupton's earnest
request, to go into the other chamber to him immediately.
</p>
<p>
This, fearing something had happened, he accordingly did; and having bid
the servant wait with a light in an unoccupied room not far off, shut the
door after him.
</p>
<p>
Near the old fire-place, in which yet burned the last embers of what had
been a comfortable fire, he found Mr. Lupton sitting in an antique carved
arm-chair, with a marvellous appearance of composure, an expression of
stillness that seemed almost unnatural, as though the finger of some awful
event had been laid upon his vital powers, and had suddenly almost stopped
them. It was as though his heart feared to beat or his lips to breathe. At
the same time his flesh was ghastly white, his features were rigid, and
his eyes dilated with an indescribable expression of terror.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Are you ill, sir?&rdquo; demanded Colin with much concern. Mr. Lupton only
pressed the hand of the young man, as if glad once more to lay hold of
flesh and blood, and then drew him close to his side, by way of reply.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I hope nothing has occurred?&rdquo; again observed Colin. &ldquo;But you are ill,&mdash;I
see you are.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo;&mdash;at length stammered his father tremulously, &ldquo;but&mdash;my boy&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;<i>have
seen her!</i>&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And at the recollection of what he had seen, or fancied he had seen, he
shook violently, as though every nerve in his body was shattered.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Seen who, sir?&rdquo; exclaimed Colin, though turning pale with the instant
flash of consciousness that he <i>knew who</i>, as well as he that sat
there unmanned and trembling.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;She has been back to me, true enough,&rdquo; said he again; and shaking his
head just as might a man upon whom the awful doubt of an after-life has
just been made a woful certainty,&mdash;a plain and demonstrative
certainty,&mdash;by the vision of an immateriality far more positive in
itself, than the plainest of those whom Shelley has so finely described as
</p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;The ghastly people of the realm of dream.&rdquo;
 </pre>
<p>
&ldquo;Never heed it now, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the young man; &ldquo;endeavour to calm
yourself, and try to forget it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Lupton incredulously: &ldquo;never,&mdash;never!&mdash;Oh
no,&mdash;no!&rdquo; And as he spoke with more energy, and raised his voice in a
pathetic manner as addressing some being unseen, he continued,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
my wife, my wife!&mdash;I am indeed wretched, very wretched!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Again Colin endeavoured to persuade him out of this painful fear; but it
was not until a considerable time had elapsed in these efforts that he
even partially succeeded. Having, however, at length done so, he sat down
beside his father and remained with him, engaged in serious conversation
until daylight on the following morning. During that discourse it is
believed Mr. Lupton informed his son of every particular touching the
sight or the imagination which had thus affected him; but farther than
that they were never made known. Mr. Lupton himself, during the whole
remainder of his life, was never known upon any occasion even to allude to
such a circumstance as having ever even happened; and no one ever ventured
to speak of it before him. While Colin himself, who on various occasions
was questioned by his friends as to the nature of the occurrences on that
mysterious night, invariably returned this answer, &ldquo;that if any
supernatural revelation had been made to his father, to him alone it
belonged to reveal it if he would: but as for himself, he could not have
anything to do with the especial secrets and the bosom business of another
individual.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
This latter sentiment, however praiseworthy, I very strongly suspect to be
but a variation of one which he had often heard, and had picked up in the
learned school of Mr. Peter Veriquear.
</p>
<p>
Deprived as the curious thus were and are of information in that
direction, it yet became well known all over the country-side, some time
afterwards, that Mr. Lupton had become remarkably serious very soon after
his wife's death; and, unlike many in similar predicaments, from whom such
conduct might more have been expected, had actually continued so ever
since.
</p>
<p>
All the able theories that had been set afloat touching his second
marriage, for everybody, who knew nothing about it, believed he would be
married again, were found, day after day, and month after month, never to
be carried out on his part by any corresponding action; so that at length
the interested portion of the neighbourhood in this question were fain to
give him credit for being a good widower, who could not find in his heart
to marry again.
</p>
<p>
Another step also, which he subsequently took, must be here recorded.
After the occurrence of the important events so recently described,
Colin's father would no longer think of permitting him and his wife again
to leave the Hall and take up their residence elsewhere, as had originally
been intended. Considering all things that had happened, and the state of
his own feelings and sentiments thereon, Mr. Lupton now declared it to be
his fixed intention to instal the young couple at once in that family
residence, which he had already made provision for eventually bequeathing
to them, and of having them considered as constituting, along with
himself, the family and owners of the place. At the same time he expressed
his earnest desire that his son Colin should take the management of his
estates, as far as possible, into his own hands; to which end he devoted
considerable pains to qualify him; observing that, however strange it
might appear, he now felt but little interest in those matters which
formerly had occupied nearly all his attention, and that for the future he
wished to devote his time to such study and pursuits as would be found
more congenial with his feelings, as well as better adapted to fit him for
that great change which in no very distant years he must undergo.
</p>
<p>
This arrangement being agreed to, and eventually acted upon, much to the
satisfaction of all parties, Colin was soon looked upon as the greatest
man in that parish where once we found him, a miserable child of
misfortune, turned rudely out of his cradle at night, and sent by a
hard-hearted steward to starve with his mother beneath the naked sky, or
find a shelter under the poorest hovel of the fields.
</p>
<p>
As to that same steward, the notorious Mr. Longstaff, whom, it may be
remembered, Colin's mother had once charged with having, in conjunction
with his wife, been the cause of her betrayal and misfortune, he had now
grown an old man, but still occupied the same situation, now that Colin
became his master, as he did when first the reader was introduced to him.
</p>
<p>
Prophecies sometimes come true; or, rather let me say, that observations
made perhaps without a definite meaning, occasionally become prophetical
as proved by the event. When Mr. Longstaff turned Mrs. Clink out of her
house on the eventful night we have just alluded to, it will not perhaps
have been forgotten that she pointed towards the little bed in which our
then little hero lay, and addressing the steward, exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>There's a
sting in that cradle for you yet!</i>&rdquo; Mr. Longstaff himself remembered
these words, and trembled when he found to what influence and station the
Squire had exalted his son. And though, I verily believe, notwithstanding
his deserts, that Colin would never have molested him, but rather have
forgiven and returned good for evil, yet, as though retributive justice
was not to be turned aside, it oddly enough was discovered by Colin and
Mr. Lupton, on examining his accounts, that certain defalcations to a
large extent and of long standing existed, and by the produce of which
knavery it was supposed he had contrived to bribe a sufficient number of
independent ten pounders in a neighbouring town to get his son, Mr.
Chatham B. Longstaff, returned to Parliament, as well as to portion off
his two daughters, Miss Æneasina Laxton and Miss Magota, on their
respective marriages; one with a well-to-do musician, and the other a
ditto draper and haberdasher.
</p>
<p>
On this discovery the steward was peremptorily discharged, on Mr. Lupton's
authority, by Colin in person, and afterwards threatened with a
prosecution. But as he made himself quite as humble as he had before been
proud, said a great many pitiful things about the dignity of his family
and the ruin of his character, as well as promised to pay the several sums
back again, if not before, at least very soon after his son should have
got a place under Government, the Squire consented, under the influence of
his son's persuasions, to let the old boy off and suffer the grievance to
be hushed up by them, and misrepresented for the better by Mr. Longstaff
himself and his clever family.
</p>
<p>
I am not certain, but to the best of my memory Mr. Longstaff eventually
established himself as landlord of a small inn in a country town some
sixty or seventy miles from the scene of his former exploits. For this
duty, in fact, he was by nature quite as well, if not better qualified,
than for some other of a more ambitious nature which he had previously
taken upon himself.
</p>
<p>
To return to our more immediate friends, it is necessary now to state,
that although Mr. Lupton had practically given up almost every power and
authority connected with his own extensive establishment and estates, and
placed them in the hands of his son, he yet deemed it his duty to continue
those official duties connected with the administration of justice which
he had fulfilled during so long a period of years. Owing to this
determination on his part it is that we stand indebted for a scene between
two old and familiar acquaintances of the reader's, which otherwise we
could not have enjoyed any possible opportunity of witnessing.
</p>
<p>
Some months had elapsed after the establishment of our hero in the house
of his father, when, one day, as he was pacing up and down the lawn, with
his wife upon his arm, he observed an unfortunate-looking woman, with a
countenance deeply expressive of disappointment and indignation, advancing
towards the Hall, and apparently from the direction of the Whinmoor-road.
The harsh and half-prim, half-slatternly outline of the figure would
instantly have assured him, even if other characteristics had failed, that
in the individual who approached he beheld the never-to-be-forgotten Miss
Sowersoft.
</p>
<p>
When sufficiently near to recognise her and be recognised by her, she came
to a full-stop, in order at a respectful distance to pass her compliments,
and evince her good-breeding by courtesying very low, and muttering, &ldquo;Good
morning to you, sir!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Good morning, Miss Sowersoft!&rdquo; answered Colin.
</p>
<p>
Again she courtesied as she addressed Mrs. Jane with another &ldquo;Good morning
to you, ma'am!&rdquo; She then continued, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, but I am not
Miss Sowersoft now. I am sure I never expected to say that I <i>regretted</i>
being Mrs. Palethorpe!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Colin. &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Palethorpe, &ldquo;I do not wish to remind you of those
circumstances&mdash;unfortunate circumstances I am sure they were&mdash;which
brought me into connexion with you in your juvenile days; but I am sure
you cannot forget what a brute that man was from first to last: you must
be aware that it was next to impossible for anybody to live in the same
house with him even at that time. But I have been a poor infatuated
creature!&rdquo; Here she began to cry. &ldquo;Though I am paying dearly for it now!
He is a sad man indeed!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Colin now observed that his old mistress had very recently been favoured
with a remarkably black eye.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Does he ill-use you?&rdquo; demanded Colin more seriously.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;He is a disgrace, sir,&mdash;though I say it that should not,&mdash;a
disgrace and scandal to the name of man! I have come here, sir, I assure
you, to see if the Squire will bind him over to keep the peace towards me;
for only last night,&mdash;and it is his regular work now he is married,
and master of the farm,&mdash;only last night he came down from Barwick as
drunk as a lord, and he insisted on having a posset immediately. The fire
was out, sir,&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Palethorpe here wept afresh,&mdash;&ldquo;and Dorothy
was gone to bed.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mrs. Palethorpe could not (for human nature will fail and sink sometimes)
get any further.
</p>
<p>
Though Colin and Jane had much ado to forbear laughing at this account of
her grievances, the former yet requested her to be comforted; and assured
her that he had no doubt Mr. Lupton would very soon take such steps with
Mr. Palethorpe as should effectually prevent him from resorting to
personal violence for the future.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;As, I suppose,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;this black eye is an evidence of some of
his handiwork?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;It is, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Samuel, with passionate firmness. &ldquo;I simply
told him as gently as I could how circumstances stood, when he made no
more to do than strike me two or three blows&mdash;he repeated them&mdash;in
the face, and made me this figure, that I am ashamed of anybody seeing
me!&rdquo; And then she covered her face with her handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
Without farther parley, Colin now bade Mrs. Palethorpe follow him, and led
her into the presence of the Squire. That gentleman, for the first time
since the death of his wife, was observed to smile when made acquainted
with the poor woman's story. In the course of making out her case, she
informed Mr. Lupton how, upon her visit with Palethorpe to London, she had
somehow consented in a foolish moment to be married to him, immediately on
their return; that, accordingly, that event had taken place at Barwick
Church; how tipsy he got the first day of their wedding; how scandalously
he had neglected everything since, except his drinking; and how abominably
he had treated her almost from that very day up to the present moment.
</p>
<p>
As Mr. Lupton had previously been made familiar with the whole story of
their love and their conduct by Colin, he did not feel any very deep grief
at Mrs. Palethorpe's present case; though, at the same time, he rejoiced
at the opportunity afforded him for punishing as degraded and criminal a
being as ever was brought before him. He accordingly issued a warrant for
Palethorpe's apprehension, and during the same day had him brought up.
When he made his appearance Colin was in the next room, and beheld a
countenance more expressive at once of the ferocious brute and the sot
than could probably be met with anywhere else throughout the country side.
Mr. Palethorpe seemed indeed to have made himself so uncommonly glorious
the night before, as to forestall all the glory of the ensuing forty-eight
hours. His eyes had much the look of a couple of red coddled gooseberries,
and his mouth that of one of those sun-made rifts which, during the dry
summer-time he trod over in his own baked fallow fields.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I didn't mean to hurt meesis!&rdquo; said he, in reply to the complaint urged
against him. &ldquo;I was raither insinuated in drink when I did it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But you must be a most brutal fellow,&rdquo; replied the Squire, &ldquo;to strike
your own wife.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
<br /><br />

<a href="images/008.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><i>Original Size</i></a>
</h4>
<p>
&ldquo;I didn't want to marry her!&rdquo; exclaimed Palethorpe. &ldquo;She collyfugled me
into it, by dint of likker and possets; and so she has herself to thank
for't!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And on the delivery of this heroic sentiment Mr. Palethorpe stared at all
present with the confidence of one who feels that the victory is already
his. Unluckily for him, however, Mr. Lupton did not take that sort of
logic as correspondent with law; but instead, ordered him to pay a crown
for having been drunk, and committed him for a fortnight to that identical
place to which the prisoner himself and his lady had once threatened to
send Colin,&mdash;I mean York Castle,&mdash;for the assault upon his wife.
In addition to this, it is perhaps scarcely necessary to add, he was bound
in sureties to keep the peace towards all the King's subjects for the
space of one year;&mdash;a restriction which not only materially lessened
the amount of domestic revolutions in the farm at Whinmoor, but also the
number of physical outbreaks at the various pot-houses and village wakes
throughout the surrounding neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>
Unblessed with any of those delightful little children to rear up and
spoil, upon which she had so enthusiastically counted,&mdash;rendered
still more crabbed than ever before by the lasting disappointment she had
experienced, Mrs. Palethorpe passed a life of that peculiar kind of misery
which has no parallel here on earth, but which any married couple desirous
of testing may do so by carrying on against each other, in small matters
as well as in great, an everlasting war of mutual annoyances and reprisals
upon each other's happiness.
</p>
<p>
In other words, she and her husband, during their whole after journey
through the world, regarded each other as the most mortal enemy that
either had ever encountered.

<h2>
CHAPTER XVII.
</h2>
<p>
<i>A village festival on a great occasion.&mdash;The woes of Mr. Peter
Veriquear.</i>
</p>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>OULD the good reader who has patiently travelled with me so far, and at
length has reached the last milestone, as it were, upon our journey, could
he, I repeat, have been present at Kiddal Hall, some five or six years
later than the occurrence of the last described events, he would have seen
a joyous sight. Once more did the old house look gay. A grand
entertainment was given to all the surrounding residents, as well as the
private friends of the occupants. Various gay devices adorned the walls;
temporary bowers and archways trimmed with ribands and flowers, were
erected in the gardens; a flag waved gloriously from the topmost peak of
the building; tables were spread over the green open space, in the middle
of the village of Bramleigh; labour was laid aside, and every soul seemed
to rejoice over the occasion of this holiday. It was May time. The
pleasant farms seemed buried in the pink and white bloom of the orchards;
the lilacs drooped over garden-walls, borne down by the weight of their
own flowers; and the sunshine flecked with beautiful patches of light the
hollow green lanes, which, throughout that rural district, formed a
welcome substitute for the hard pavement and the unpicturesque dwellings
of a great city.
</p>
<p>
By a special act on the part of Mr. Lupton, it had some time before been
settled, that Colin and his wife should thenceforth take the family name,
as though no other had been borne by them. This had accordingly been done;
and therefore, I may now declare, that on this day (the happy day here
spoken of) was celebrated the birth of the first son of Colin and Jane
Lupton. Already had they been blessed with two girls, that now had become
by far the prettiest ornaments, the most beloved treasures, of the house.
But the birth of a son was, as usual in similar cases, an event to be
regarded with far greater interest, arising from circumstances which it
would be superfluous to explain. Proudly did these two young and happy
people walk amongst the tenantry, rejoicing in the earnest good wishes
which, were heard on every side, for their long life and continued
happiness: though in one sense, more proudly still did the father of Colin
himself look upon the generous homage thus paid them, and in the silent
thankfulness of his own breast contemplate the rising and beautiful little
family around him.
</p>
<p>
To add to the general joy of the friends assembled at the Hall, Mr. Roger
Calvert and Fanny Woodruff, after a courtship of unaccountable duration,
had selected that day also as their wedding-day; and now, along with the
father of the latter, and the whole family of the former, (for it is
needless almost to say, that a reconciliation between them and Colin had
long ago been effected,) joined at once in each other's pleasure, and that
of the inhabitants of Kiddal.
</p>
<p>
One incident alone, which is worthy of particular record, occurred to cast
a temporary sadness over this scene of festive rejoicing: an incident
which, though it began in mirth, concluded with a brief tale of misfortune
and endurance, which for some time afterwards caused Colin to forget his
own happiness, in contemplating the misfortune and helpless poverty of one
whom we may term an old acquaintance.
</p>
<p>
Somewhere about dusk in the evening, Colin walked forth into the village,
for the purpose of witnessing the enjoyment of others; and amongst many
other signs that all were happy and contented, he observed a knot of
country bumpkins gathered round something which had attracted their
attention in the middle of the highway, and that appeared to afford them
the highest degree of amusement, judging by the frequent and loud peals of
boisterous laughter which broke from the assembled crowd. No sooner did
the latter observe who approached, than they respectfully fell back, in
order to allow him a sight of the object they had surrounded. Colin
instantly perceived a man past the middle age, and, apparently, worn down
by trouble and poverty combined, with a pack on his back, not unlike a
travelling pedlar,&mdash;a stick in his hand to assist him in his
progress, and a small, shaggy, wiry-haired terrier, cringing in alarm
close at his heels.
</p>
<p>
The first sight of this odd figure was quite sufficient to assure Colin
that he beheld no other than poor Peter Veriquear himself! Colin instantly
ordered the people to stand back; and, to the amazement of all the
clod-hoppers around, hurriedly seized him by the hand, with the
exclamation&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Veriquear!&mdash;Or is it possible I can be
mistaken?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Whether you are mistaken or not,&rdquo; replied the individual thus addressed,
&ldquo;is your own business and not mine. Just as it is my business to say I am
very glad to see my old assistant, Mr. Colin Clink.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;But how,&mdash;under what strange circumstances have you come here, and
in this manner?&rdquo; demanded Colin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;you must be aware is my own concern and not yours.
Though perhaps,&rdquo;&mdash;and he paused a moment,&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps I ought to
make it my business to tell you all about it.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; responded Colin, &ldquo;for I can assure you, in your own language,
that I feel it to be my business to know. But come,&rdquo; he continued, and at
the same time motioning as though to lead him away,&mdash;&ldquo;let me conduct
you to better quarters than you will at present find in the village, and
where we can talk over in a more private manner those things which I
certainly feel somewhat anxious to hear.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
To this proposal Mr. Veriquear at once assented, with the remark that as
Mr. Clink made it his own business to take him to good quarters, it could
not possibly be any concern of his to object. And accordingly Mr. Peter
Veriquear and his dog accompanied Colin to Kiddal Hall, where the
first-named gentleman soon found himself seated at a plentiful table in
the great kitchen, while the companion of his travels was accommodated,
much to his satisfaction, with equally as abundant a meal provided for him
at the entrance to an empty kennel which stood in the court-yard.
</p>
<p>
When Peter had sufficiently satisfied himself after this fashion, he
attended the summons of the friend who assuredly in former times had been
indebted to him, and was conducted into a private room where Colin had
proposed to meet him alone.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ah, sir!&rdquo; said Peter, as he took a chair and placed himself over against
Colin, &ldquo;you will feel quite as much astonished to find me sunk so low, as
I am to see how high you have risen. Though to be sure,&rdquo; he continued
hesitatingly, &ldquo;it is your business to be astonished at me, as it is mine
to do the same by you.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Why, what can possibly have happened?&rdquo; asked the other.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Sad things!&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;In the first place, I have lost every one&mdash;there
is not a single soul left&mdash;of all my family. Mrs. Veriquear,&mdash;the
little Veriquears that you used to take such pleasure in drawing about in
the coach,&mdash;all have been taken away from me. One of those horrible
fevers which it is the business of Providence sometimes to send into the
heart of a great city like that in which I lived, laid them down almost
all together on beds of sickness. They lay ill for some time, during which
the doctor made it his affair to physic them so much that the stock of
bottles in my warehouse was very materially increased. At the same time
the rag trade was torn to rags by competition; while the 'rents' became
bigger every year in proportion. One after another the family dropped off;
until really, grieved as I was, I could not help thinking that the
undertaker did nothing in the world else but make it his business to go
backwards and forwards from his own house to mine.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Colin scarcely knew in what manner to reply to this statement, as it would
have raised a smile on the face of Pity herself; but by dint of
considerable efforts he contrived to look sufficiently grave, and bid Mr.
Veriquear proceed.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The consequence of all this was that nearly everything I had saved to
keep my family alive, was spent in putting them into the ground. The
marrow, as I may say, of my bone of fortune was picked out, and my poverty
was left with scarcely a rag to cover her. However, I thought it my best
way to bottle up my complaints; and since Providence had made it her
business to visit me with afflictions, I would make it mine to endure as
patiently as I could.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;A worthy resolution!&rdquo; observed his auditor, &ldquo;and very highly to your
credit.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;However,&rdquo; continued Peter, &ldquo;after these misfortunes were over, my old
house seemed such a desert to me that I could not endure it. Everywhere it
appeared that I ought to meet one or other of them, and yet I was always
disappointed,&mdash;always alone! Used to having those little people for
ever about my feet,&mdash;to feed them at my table,&mdash;to talk about
them to my wife,&mdash;to think how I should dispose of them as they grew
up, and speculate on their luck in after-life,&mdash;and thus suddenly to
be deprived of them all,&mdash;to have all swept away,&mdash;not one left,&mdash;not
a solitary one! to be myself the only one where there had been many,&mdash;I
assure you, sir, that sometimes I felt terrified at my own shadow as it
chased along the wall by lamplight, and seemed to reproach me with being
the only creature left there alive. I could have fancied myself like a
solitary spider in a huge closet of a house without any other tenant, and
that has nothing to do but sit in the heart of its own web, silently
waiting and waiting for other living things besides itself, which never
come, until at length it withers imperceptibly, and is found dead in its
home by some visitor at last.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Peter's feelings had now made him too eloquent even for himself, and
certain hard tears which appeared to be looking about for, and puzzled to
find a furrow to run in, scrambled oddly down his cheeks.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The place,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;made me nervous. Sometimes I fancied I heard
the voices of my children crying above stairs, or below, or laughing in
the yard. I have even been foolish enough, weak enough, to make it my
business to go up or down sometimes to see. The little chairs and stools
were there, or, perhaps, the playthings I had once chidden them for
breaking. How I then regretted it! Could I have had them back again, they
might have pulled my very house to pieces, but I should have been a happy
man! If you have children, sir, may you never lose them as I have done!&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Colin could not but feel Mr. Veriquear's words, while he requested him to
conclude his narrative.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; added Peter, &ldquo;I made it my business to dispose of my business,
and sell all off I had. And though it was a good deal to look at, it
produced me little money. However, as I could no longer endure the place,
I made the best of the case I could, and resolved to travel back to the
place where I originally came from, and pass the rest of my life there,
without any other attempt to make my fortune.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;And, pray, Mr. Veriquear,&rdquo; asked his entertainer, &ldquo;in what part of the
country may that be?&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was born,&rdquo; answered Peter, &ldquo;in one of the Orkney Islands, and am now
going back on foot, as you see me; only as I supposed very possibly I
might find you here, or, at least, hear something of you, I came partly
out of my way in order to do so; and, in fact, I was making inquiries of
those clowns at the very time that you made it your business to come up to
me.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
Mr. Colin Lupton certainly felt more on hearing this story than he
expressed in words to the relater of it. But by his actions its effect
upon him may be judged, as he insisted on poor Peter being well lodged for
the night, and before his departure on the following day, made him such a
present as, most probably, would entitle him to be considered a man of
some small substance in the little Orkney Island, towards which he shortly
afterwards finally steered his course.
</p>
<p>
Having now brought the fortunes of most of the principal characters who
have figured in these pages to a close, it only remains for me to relate
some few stray scraps of information upon subjects on which the reader may
not now feel fully satisfied.
</p>
<p>
It will, perhaps, be remembered, that the last time we parted with Doctor
Rowel,&mdash;that infamous agent in as infamous a description of practice
as ever man carried on and escaped the gallows,&mdash;we left him in a
state of high mental excitement, bound in his carriage and conveyed by his
friends to the house of his brother, on the borders of Sherwood forest. To
reduce that excitement, or even to prevent its eventually increasing to a
state of violent and confirmed madness, all medicine, restraint, or care,
was found unavailing; and, eventually, he was confined for life in a
public institution for the reception of demented individuals. There he
raved almost continually about an imaginary skeleton, in an imaginary box,
which he supposed to be placed close to his bedside. He declared it lied
for having told such tales of him; and often gave utterance to certain
unintelligible jargon, wherein the names of Woodruff, of his sister
Frances, and of his niece, were mingled in curious confusion. Sometimes he
would roll on the ground, and cry out, as though some powerful hand was on
his throat, and a weight upon his breast&mdash;telling, almost, that the
fearful struggle between his former prisoner and himself, yet retained
doubtful hold upon his mind, and yet occasionally punished him over again,
more severely perhaps than even at the period of its actual occurrence.
Altogether he continued to exhibit to the very last a picture of misery
and horror, not easily, even if it were needful, to be described.
</p>
<p>
With respect to Mrs. Luptons early friend, Miss Mary Shirley, her entire
devotion to that unfortunate lady, through a long period of years, the
tenderness with which she had comforted her in her afflictions, and the
constancy with which she had maintained the spirits of that unhappy wife,
endeared her to all who in the least were acquainted with her merits. For
a while she took upon herself, at Mrs. Jane's earnest entreaty, and in
conjunction with herself, the management of Colin's little family.
